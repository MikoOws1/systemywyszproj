"""cabin temperature was much too low""","I recently flew with Swiss Air on the Bucharest to Zurich route in an Airbus A220. Despite the overall comfort of the aircraft and the friendliness of the cabin crew, the cabin temperature was much too low and could not be adjusted, despite our requests. The crew was kind and suggested we wear warmer clothes, assuring us that the situation would improve over time. Unfortunately, the temperature remained consistently low throughout the flight, making the journey less comfortable than we would have liked. Nevertheless, the aircraft was modern and clean, and the staff provided prompt and friendly service. If it weren't for the temperature issue, I would have had a very pleasant experience. If the temperature cannot be adjusted immediately, the company could provide passengers with additional blankets to offer them thermal comfort. Overall, my flight experience with Swiss Air was good, but the temperature issue left a negative impression.",1,5,Ciprian Constantinescu,2025-01-12,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,Bucharest to Zurich,January 2025,5,4,3,4,4,Swiss International Air Lines
"""fallen so far in terms of spirit""","My third long-haul flight in SWISS Business Class this year has left me disappointed. In January, the amenity kit came in a Victorinox aluminum box, albeit with minimal contents inside a plastic bag. By November, the box was gone, and now in December, the situation remains unchanged. The plastic bag still contains instructions referencing the aluminum box. I had to specifically request the box from a kind flight attendant.

"""Shameful customer service""","Shameful customer service. Flight was ok but my luggage was somehow lost in the process and delivered to final destination after a couple of days. I was on holidays, thus bought the basic necessities on the day of my arrival, so my son and I had something to wear in this lapse of time. The treatment of my refund claim by Swiss Airlines has been mediocre. To start with, it took me 3 attempts to file the claim via their website, although all 3 claims were done in the exact same way, before it was finally acknowledged by email. In the meantime, I also tried to reach Swiss customer service by phone, trying 5 different phone numbers, each person redirecting me to a different internal department, which seems to be the only thing at which Swiss excels. As this led nowhere, I filed a complaint with Lufthansa. This too was unsuccessful, as the company rightly stated that the flight was operated by Swiss Airline and that it was up to them to sort out the problem. Despite my email reminders, there has been no follow-up on my claim (although I do have a claim, reference number 2410-LX-03571). I phoned Swiss customer service, who told me that it was impossible to deal with requests other than buying tickets over the phone, and that they couldn't transfer me internally as there was no competent department able to manage my claim (?!). I'm astounded by the non-existence (and on the rare occasions when I've managed to speak to someone, incompetence) of Swiss Airlines customer service. Until now, I have been unable to take my case any further with them, either by email or by telephone.

The Service: The staff were perfectly friendly, kind and polite with us and offered us chocolates and water during the flight. The chocolate was tasty and the water was normal. The Ground Service: The flight was perfectly on time and we landed on schedule. The boarding was normal and bar a bus gate was completely seamless. Overall, the flight was seamless and comfortable.

"""seats are not refundable""",I bought a refundable ticket for me and my wife and we selected and paid for seats. Nowhere in the booking process does it say that the seats are not refundable and it stands to reason that if you buy a refundable ticket that the entire purchase is refundable.

“service was notably rude”,"Our experience on Swiss Airlines flight LX 161 from Tokyo to Zurich left us disappointed. Originally, we were booked on a direct KLM flight to Amsterdam, which was canceled, forcing us to reroute through Zurich with Swiss and lose a day of work. The service was notably rude. A specific stewardess (initials G.M.) was dismissive from the start. When my friend politely asked for a snack during this 14-hour flight, she gave him a lecture on why passengers should bring their own food. Eventually, she gave him a sandwich but later insisted he couldn’t have another, even though the same sandwiches were handed out to other passengers with plenty to spare. Further, when I requested tea during a water service, I received a sharp “absolutely not.” Moments later, we saw another passenger receiving Baileys from another steward. This led to a tense exchange where the stewardess scolded her colleague openly in front of all passengers. Throughout the flight, she showed similar disregard for others, lecturing passengers about minor issues and creating an overall uncomfortable atmosphere. A smile was notably absent the entire flight. While we understand the demands on cabin crew, this level of unprofessionalism was surprising. We hope Swiss Airlines addresses this kind of behavior, as it fell short of basic service standards and made the journey unnecessarily tense.",1,2,S V Ours,2024-10-31,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,Tokyo to Amsterdam via Zurich,October 2024,2,1,3,1,1,Swiss International Air Lines
"""not be flying Swiss again""","4 of us traveled roundtrip from Boston to Brindisi, Italy with a stopover in Zurich. The seats are so squished together in economy, we barely fit. I'm on the tall side, had to sit sideways. (I've been on much more comfortable seats in the US for much shorter flights.) When the person in front reclines, I had only about 4"" of space in front of my nose. Really? I was so miserable that I had an anxiety attack. On our flight to Zurich, we were so late that we had to be rushed through the airport to make our connection. Yes, we made it .. but our luggage did not for 3 days! Imagine being in Puglia with perfect weather and not being able to swim. And when it finally did arrive, mine was destroyed and my husband's luggage was damaged. We finally were transferred to a luggage company who agreed that our brand new luggage was destroyed and agreed to give us credits .. not cash .. but credits only to buy new luggage from THEM. (We are still waiting for 2 new pieces to arrive.) Then on our return flights, another bag from one in our group did not make it to Boston. It took 5 days for it to arrive at their home in Colorado. Needless to say we will not be flying Swiss again. Must say one positive thing though; the food was good and the stewardesses were very nice.

"""my daughter’s stroller was lost""","Absolutely horrible airline. The catastrophe started in Toronto when we were over an hour delayed leaving the tarmac. Everyone else was departing with no issues. No explanation why. The flight itself was awful. Hard  seats, no leg room for such a long flight.  We finally arrive in Zurich over an hour late only to discover we have 30 mins to run across the entire airport to catch our flight to Naples (this is the day before our wedding!). We make it on board luckily, only to arrive in Naples and be stranded for 6+ hours because they didn’t send our luggage. I tried contacting them while stranded at the airport in Italy. Zero support. They just kept redirecting me to file a lost baggage claim. My packages on Amazon have better tracking! The airlines charge you so much for your luggage and then they don’t care what happens to them after. After waiting almost 7 hours our three suitcases by the grace of God arrived. Only to find out that my daughter’s stroller was lost. It’s still lost. I submitted a claim over two weeks ago, I haven’t heard from anyone just keep getting automated responses that they are very busy right now.

“the most uncomfortable flight”,"We flew from PDX to PMO w 2 stops, SFO and Zurich. The shorter flights, operated by different airlines, were both fine. The longest leg of the trip was 11hrs from SFO to ZUR and operated by Swiss. It was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on in my life. I travel a lot, both domestically in the US and internationally (annual special trips are usually international). It was basically like sitting in wooden folding chairs. There was 0 padding and the angle forced pressure on your tailbone, resulting in pinched sciatic nerves for all 6 in our party. The smallest person in our group wears a mens US medium and is 5ft 6in tall. He filled his seat entirely and had to put his backpack in the overhead storage to have any legroom in the extra legroom seat. My seat had a bar from the seat in front of us right down the middle of where my legs would go, as the seat legs are not lined up evenly, so I had to put my legs in one of my neighbors areas or pull my knees to my chest not to bother them. If I pulled my knees up to my chest, though, I no longer fit in my seat. I had to keep my arms crossed in front of me to pull my shoulders in, which caused pain in my back and neck. We purchased extra legroom at $92 per person. Absolutely a rip off, but also, we are forced to do this again for the return trip because otherwise we won't be able to walk at all when we get home because the economy seating in the back is absolute hell, built for children. The cabin of the plane was a sauna, leaving us and everyone else on the plane dripping with sweat the entire 11hrs. While the staff were nice enough, every time they brought the beverage and food service carts down the super skinny aisles, they bumped them along the seats the entire way up and down. The food was mediocre, at best. They put fruit in the macaroni and cheese!?! There were 2 options for dinner, my husband got the other option, which looked like chunky baby food (some kind of curry chicken?) and he said it tasted like something from a can that say in a pantry for a few years. ""Breakfast"" was cheap yogurt and leftover dinner rolls. We were forced to check all of our carry on at SFO by Swiss, along w our preplanned checked bags, which has been checked at PDX. The sizes were confirmed in advance and no larger than anyone else's on the flight, so this seemed extremely arbitrary. They said we would receive it at PMO. They then proceeded to lose all of our carry on luggage. We had no clothes or toiletries and have been forced to spend hundreds of what was meant to be souvenir money on these items because we only had the clothes we traveled in and a few pieces from the overflow preplanned checked bags we brought (for souvenirs). There are no live people to speak with on the matter. They force you to go through an online reporting process that's a total nightmare and refuse to compensate the disruption in any way or even offer an insincere apology, for that matter. They claim the luggage handling isn't really their responsibility... basically it's a ""you gambled, buddy, not our fault you lost"" attitude, even though they force you to take said gamble. We had to sacrifice an entire day of our vacation driving back to PMO to pick up our luggage when it was eventually found. I will never fly this airline again and crushed I have to fly them home. It will cost a small fortune in healthcare to fix our backs and legs with massage therapy and chiropractic care when we do get home.

It could not be exchanged for another drink e.g. water or tea. The staff was very unhelpful and completely without understanding e.g. for mothers with children who were not even allowed to board first.

"""unable to execute those changes""","I booked business class flights with SWISS International Air Lines for my family's Christmas vacation. We now decided to extend our vacation by one week, so I wanted to change our return flights accordingly.

The rebooking was confirmed on the site and I got charged 171.08 euros from my credit card, just as offered on the website. Everything fine so far. Later during the day I noticed that the payment was charged twice from my card. I also never received any rebooking confirmation from SWISS via email. I contacted the company through their live chat on the same day. The result was surprising: I spent 6 hours  in this chat to learn that SWISS denied both the rebooking and the charges on my credit card.  I then decided to file a complaint through their contact form on the website and got an automated reply: I shouldn't be worried about the blocked amount on my credit card it would be released shortly. There was no blocked amount - the payment was done and the money was charged to my card and booked from my bank account. SWISS also didn't even mention the missing rebooking confirmation, as if this never happened.

We were supposed to start boarding the plane around 2140 pm. Nothing happened until around 2230 and the plane was supposed to take off at 2240. Then the announcement came that the flight was cancelled. No explanation was given. The person in charge then announced that passengers in Business Class go to a transfer desk and all others to get their luggage and look for hotel accommodation on their own. And we were told that immigration would be closing soon and we had to act fast and go reclaim our luggage if we want to leave the Airport. My wife and I are in our 70’s and unfamiliar with Zürich, let alone find a hotel at midnight. Nevertheless we managed to find a hotel some distance from the airport with the help of another stranded passenger. The poor handling of the situation by Swissair leaves much to be desired. The staff was curt and unhelpful and was in a hurry to get rid of us. At the very least, they could have given us a list of hotels to accommodate us. Instead, we had to go around in a taxi looking for hotels after midnight. Our taxi fare amounted to Chf 102 and the hotel charged us Chf266. To add insult to injury, we were rebooked to return to Singapore via Narita, a journey of more than 29 hours. Thank goodness we were able to secure a direct flight on Singapore Airlines the next day, which meant an additional day stay in Zurich.

"""the worst Business Class""","We've traveled all around the world on numerous different airlines, but Swiss Air takes the crown for the worst Business Class experience. Check in process at LAX was horrible. The counter personnel were not friendly and it was very obvious they did not care about customer experience what so ever. Very inefficient process in checking in customers. We've never waited this long in a business class line ever. Boarding process was another disaster. The most inefficient boarding we've ever witnessed. Of course it's the same crew that checked us in, so go figure. Plane is delayed 1.5 hours. Food on board was average. Possibly the most uncomfortable business class seats we've been on. Arrive in Zurich and 2 out of our 3 luggage's don't arrive. Around 30 people in the same predicament. We are told to file a baggage delay claim on their website and wait until further notice. Luggage arrives in Zurich 3 days later! We are in St. Moritz and have to pay for a taxi ride back to Zurich which is 3 hours away to the tune of 690 chf. Flight back to LAX. Flight is delayed again, but this time for 3 hours! Same again, extremely inefficient boarding process. Never seen such a slow boarding process. Flight crew on board this flight is the worst I have ever seen. Not attentive and too busy socializing with each other. I go to use the restroom and come back to see an extra blanket in front of my seat on the floor. I ask my wife and she says there was someone's blanket in the aisle and the flight attendant came through and just moved it with her feet to in front of my seat. For starters how can a flight attendant kick someone's blanket instead of picking it up? I push the blanket back into the aisle to see how they would address it. Two flight attendants pass by to go socialize with a passenger behind me and just walk over the blanket in the aisle! Wow! They do it again on the way back. I stop them and asked why they put someone else's blanket in my seat and why would they just walk past it like this. Their response? Oh ok, and they just picked it up and left. No apologies whatsoever! I stop a second attendant to address the same issue and responds by saying, did you talk to my colleague? I respond, yes I did and she says ok then. Do you want some chocolate? REALLY? The restrooms? They don't bother cleaning them up during the entire flight! Airlines like Korean Air have flight attendants go inside the restrooms after every customer leaves to tidy things up. Swiss Air? They don't bother the entire 12 hour flight. It's absolutely disgusting. It is very obvious that this was not just a case of a bad flight. This is a corporate culture where the customer experience is not at the forefront of how they conduct business. Processes are there for the employees benefit and not the customer. Needless to say, we will never fly on Swiss Air or it's corporate affiliates like Austria Air or Lufthansa. When we go back to Switzerland (and we will because it's such a beautiful country), we will go back to flying Air France through Paris like our previous visits.

"""I found the solution absurd""","All 4 flights- Greece and back to Spain were delayed. On my way back I could not check in to my 2nd leg flight - Zurich to Malaga. I tried and tried, then decided to go and find help as phone lines were off (I started around midnight before my sleep as flight was 15:50), I tried reaching out to live chat agent, who after back and fourth till circa 2am told me and I wish I had a screenshot , go to Corfu airport 3-4 hours prior and they will print it there.  Ok, will have to lose half day and after breakfast linger around hotel and go directly to the airport for 12 to get the ticket due to their fault. I gave my last try and called their customer services as I found the solution absurd, again phone centre staff after 30 min could not provide answer nor ticket and again said go to Corfu airport and manually get checked by Swiss. I arrived at the airport to be told it can only be done at the counter and that it does not open till 2 hours prior the flight - misinformed and lost holiday time. I waited two hours, killed time and finally check in started. Waited in the queue finally get to the counter. Business Counter, lady serving business passengers says she needs my passport and that her supervisor will need to fix it , it will take couple minutes. OK i give my passport, she did not come or took me somewhere, she just kept me and continued with other passengers. I kept standing and waiting for 20min.  After another 5min, I said I am done, get her here  and still no ticket nor passport not even sorry. Supervisor comes and says nobody is picking up the phone you will have to do it Zurich. I lost sleep, half a day of my holiday , came early just to get that?  Rude and unhelpful. So went to the Edelweiss Corfu to Zurich flight, departing in 1 hour at that point. I come thru security and it is gate 6B, shut from public, so everyone business and economy sitting next to the door as airport is packed. The room shut but empty.

"""I requested a refund""","Swiss, as well as the group to which it belongs, is deteriorating more and more, especially in the disrespectful way they treat their customers before the flight, even when we travel in business class. In this case, it is a flight for January 2025 with Austrian Airlines but booked through Swiss, so I have to deal with Swiss. I receive a terse message from Swiss informing me that on the return from Thailand with a stopover in Vienna, the last flight from Vienna to Geneva is canceled. I would therefore have to spend the whole night at Vienna airport and take the flight the next morning. On their website, we have the choice to either accept or get a refund, with no other alternatives. (I should remind you that the closer we get to departure, the higher the fares; getting a refund means paying more with another airline than if we had booked on the date of our booking with Swiss). They do not even offer to provide us with a hotel night. I spend two hours with their online chat. I manage to get them to book the return flight on a Swiss flight, passing through Zurich. I see that the flight appears on my account in the app. I am happy and thank them. Four days later, I find that the flight from Bangkok to Zurich has disappeared, and there is the flight forcing me to spend the night in Vienna. I understand that the chat agent did not have the right to transfer me from Austrian to Swiss, even though the ticket had already been paid by Swiss. I write through their form, specifying that the flight via Zurich had been booked during the chat, and that they removed it without even bothering to inform me.

"""upgrade was only for the second leg""","During my online check-in, I selected an upgrade for a two leg flight. I got the new boarding pass immediately, only to see that the upgrade was only for the second leg of the flight which was 1 hour - as opposed to the whole travel (the first leg was 8 hrs). I am thinking why even bother offering an upgrade for the 1hr portion and why was it almost invisible to see that this upgrade was only for a tenth of the journey? I called customer service right away - I ended up talking to three different people that gave me the run around, including one hanging up on me. I decided to wait till I got to the airport, the next day, to get a proper response. The next day on check-in, I talk to the manager who makes a call and assures me that the refund would happen in 8-10 business days, my flight was May 17. He tells me what to say on boarding the second leg of the flight etc, assuring me things are on the system. June 10 I decide to call in again to follow-up on the refund as it still hadn't gone through. This time the CSR tells me right away that the request to process it just went to the refund department that day and I need to wait 8-10 business days. Despite it being well over the said wait time, I decide it's OK, I'll wait. Two weeks later, I find myself calling their CS again - only to be told this time that there is no refund on my file and they cannot help me. There is no other number to call - only a form online, which I already filled. I noticed everytime I called in to the CS, all their reps consistently had the following, an attitude, and wouldn't let you finish your sentence. Very unprofessional for a company like SWISS. At this point I am frustrated because how can so many different SWISS airline employees give me different stories. So I take this query to social media. Now I am told that there is no indication of what I speak and they will open an investigation and will get in touch with me. There's no complaint code, time frame, contact or number to follow-up. So just like the last two times, I am a sitting duck and will have to likely start this process ALL over again. It is appalling how backward their service is - including their online marketing which has brought me to this stage. How can you dupe customers into spending money, then provide customer service that just placates you on a false narrative?  I was on the 1 hour flight looking at the so called upgrade - it was the first row of seats and had the tiniest curtain that just covered the head area, and they got water between the time they boarded and got off.

“service improved significantly finally”,"Swiss used to be my favourite airline but the last couple of years I was under the impression their quality was going down rapidly (despite ticket prices just increased constantly). On European flights I witnessed they were serving a kind of cheap sparkling wine (Baccarat) instead of champagne (if already offered-on a few short flights they just served coffee or tea in business class). The nice and tasteful light meals they used to serve were substituted by sandwiches they previously used to serve in economy! For my recent Bangkok to Brussels flight Swiss was one of the only options left so I gave them one more try. I was pleasantly surprised service improved significantly finally. The crew were nice and friendly while previously Swiss crews often left a cold and disinterested impression. For me, a crew makes or breaks the flight experience. I was seated in a throne seat that offered a lot of space and seating comfort. Meals were really good and they were able to offer me my preferred selections which wasn’t the case on previous flights with them. It was hard for me to choose the best pairing wines but they offered me to do wine tastings of all whites and reds available so I could select my preferred ones (no need to say I really appreciated this). Only downside perhaps was the flight map wasn’t working on this flight so it was guessing how much time we still had left in the air. Having Senator status I had access to the Swiss Alpine lounge at Zürich airport before boarding my connecting flight to Brussels; this lounge is really very nice and never seems to get crowed.

As always good product on SWISS 777 and food and seat etc. were ok, except for the entertainment options. However, staff were more than disappointing: while the service on the other aisle was fast, efficient and nice, the staff member on our side was slow, unfriendly, disinterested and, to make matters worse, more or less exclusively occupied with private conversations with other fellow travellers who also belonged to SWISS. No greeting, no farewell - as a status customer and a fully paid business class ticket, I have little understanding for this kind of behaviour. The aircraft was clean, the flight on time - as you would expect from SWISS.

"""the most uncomfortable flight!","I had originally heard good things about Swiss Air from a friend, but after flying with them twice (connecting flights), I disagree. I flew Swiss Air going from Oslo to Los Angeles. The day we flew out of the Oslo airport it shut down due to a snowstorm so our flight was delayed 8 hours, which the airline had no control over. However, once we were able to board again, the only consolidation prize we got was free coffee/tea, but we still had to pay for all other snacks and services… I’m pretty sure the coffee/tea was already free to start with. Like really, that’s the best you can do? Anyways, once we got to Zurich, we had to rebook a connecting flight back home to LA due to the delay. The flight from Zurich to LA was roughly 12 hours and was probably the worst flight of my life. At the boarding gate, they made us get special stamps on our boarding passes and if we didn’t have them then we couldn’t board. There was a bunch of confusion as to where to get the stamps and long lines started forming around the boarding area. It delayed our flight leaving by roughly 30 minutes. Once my family and I finally got up to board, they grabbed our bags and told us we had to check them. We were row 30 (only 3 rows behind business class) so it’s not like we were the last to board or like we were in the very back of the plane. After they took our bags I pleaded to keep them, and if we couldn’t find room for them overhead then we’d bring them back and they could be checked. I stressed how this would cause a big inconvenience to us because once we landed we still had a 2 hour drive home and baggage claim in LA can take an hour or more since it’s a busy airport. They didn’t seem to care and continued to tell us it was a full flight and they wouldn’t fit. The thing that really annoyed me was that they let people boarding after us walk on with their luggage AND once the boarding process was complete there were 4 completely empty overhead bins by our seats. I was livid. Once we got in the aircraft it was like a swamp, it was uncomfortably warm, humid, and smelled like sweat and feet. The Boeing 777-300 plane we were on didn’t have any overhead fans. I told the flight attendant I was feeling warm (I have a condition where my body overheats very easily) and she told me that air only circulates when the plane is in motion so I had to sit uncomfortably for 30-45 minutes before they turned on the air. Even after it was turned on during the flight, it felt very inconsistent, and would switch between hot and cold throughout the whole flight. I would also like to add that their economy seats are much smaller than an average plane. I fly internationally roughly 5 times a year, and I’ve taken multiple airlines throughout my life and almost always fly economy. I could barely eat the meal they provided us because my elbows would be touching the people next to me when cutting up my food (I was in the middle seat). It was incredibly frustrating, I felt like I was boxed in. Their trash service was also inconsistent, and after every meal service, our trash was was left on our table for roughly 45 minutes to an hour. I counted and trash service only came by four times on a 12 hour flight. There were two times when I had to get up and throw away my own trash, because I wanted to use my tray table but couldn’t. At the end of the flight, I was so frustrated that I literally started crying an hour before we landed. It was the most uncomfortable flight I’ve ever taken.",1,1,Christina Hornbaker,2024-03-22,no,Economy Class,Family Leisure,Oslo to Los Angeles via Zürich,March 2024,1,3,2,1,2,Swiss International Air Lines

"""complete lack of customer service""","One of the worst experiences! Direct flight departure scheduled at 12:05. Cancelled! Offered a new booking 7 hours later with change in Munich for a scheduled new arrival time around 22! Which not even is about 9 hours later as planned but also force you to make a stop in Germany instead of a direct flight. Rules of the airline are very clear that if a flight for whatever reason a flight is cancelled, they have to offer you the Same alternative. At the counter they tell you it’s not possible, they are all booked! Well, let’s raise the tone and remind them about their obligations towards their clients. I did it started a heavy discussion and, suddenly 2 places are available for a departure at 17! This is completely unacceptable and shows the way how they try to treat people. Ok! I will Not let it sit quiet like that. That’s why I’m first writing that review here, and will escalate it tomorrow, on Monday. Worst is they tried to send us via Munich, when they know that they have big strikes going on in Germany. Really! What a poor behavior, a poor customer service, a non existing hot line, a stupid chat bot and of course, no one available for direct contact. Definitely not the best way to keep customers. It was the first time, I could try to accept or understand it. But sadly all my latest flights were with problems.

You book a flight online with a suitcase of 23 kg and hand luggage of 10 kg. Nothing special. It is also stated in your confirmation and on your ticket. Only if you change planes in Zurich does this 10 kg of hand luggage suddenly change to 8 kg. You are not allowed to take more with you. My hand luggage was refused. The ground staff was curt and very unfriendly. Customer service also does not respond to this remarkable action. Unprofessional!

“Still no explanation and no apology”,"My wife and I regularly fly to Switzerland by SWISS. However, in February 2023 at Frankfurt, when the power was accidentally cut to Lufthansa systems, our problems seemed to start. The day it happened we were flying from LHR to GVA. When we tried to make the return journey, our booking had disappeared from the system. We had to pay for new seats to get home. My wife suffers from mild claustrophobia, so I always book and pay for specific seats near the front. Since then almost every booking has been changed, without notice, at least three or four times. Every time when I query, the same reason is given; “a plane change”. The problem with this is the type of plane does not change; the seat plan / format does not change, therefore our seats should not change? The airline has a seating policy, which basically says you can play for your seat but we will decide where you eventually sit. For example, on one flight I booked row 7; the system moved us to row 9 to 11 to 19. Same seat plan, no explanation, no apology. Twelve months later, the call centre staff are admitting they don’t know why the system is doing this and they have no control over it.

"""a shame what Swiss turned into""","Enough is enough, it is such a shame what Swiss turned into. Once known for its quality, punctuality and reliability, now it is simply a cheap (in quality, not in price) Easyjet. And it just keeps getting worse. Me and my husband as well as our families travel often and it is hard to remember now when was the last time Swiss was not delayed (I wonder how Swiss people feel about such airline representing their country). Today, last flight from London to Zurich, 1 hour delay. What means for evening flights, you get home not just 1 hour but much later, as public transport/taxi connections become limited. There was a man on the flight saying to the crew that he will not be able to get to Luzern as trains there stop running at 23.45. The response from Swiss crew member was that they are not responsible for Swiss railways. Well, this situation would not have happened if Swiss (again!) wasnt late. Now its almost 1 am, we are not yet home (even though we live in Zurich itself) - and tomorrow need to wake up at 5 am for work. These constant delays come on top of cramped (although clean) planes without any entertainment on european flights and outdated on long haul flights, no snacks/food, only small bottle of water and chocolate on the flights, frequent flyer program with constant ""technical errors"" and quite random bad seats to change which i need to pay 35 chf each for 1h 10 mins flight?

That is Swiss. Services of a low-cost at a premium price. They charge you for everything, but have old planes, even the seats are paid only or they will always get you the worst one ever possible.

"""one of the most cramped economy 777 cabins""","10 abreast in any 777 economy cabin feels cramped, because it is cramped; narrow seats and aisles and a claustrophobic feel. Swiss have a similar seat pitch to most other 777 operators, but having flown Qatar, Eva Air and Egyptair 777s in the past few months (the latter has the rare, 9 abreast configuration), there is noticeably less legroom (or knee room to be more precise!) in the Swiss 777; pretty awful to experience on long haul. The seat recline seems much greater than on other airlines so if you have a selfish passenger in front of you who reclines fully, the experience becomes utterly miserable and the screen and tray table become effective unusable and trying to get out of your seat is fun and games. I was also glad that I hadn’t upgraded to Premium Economy as there are only a few PE rows tacked onto the front of the economy cabin and the seats and space looked decidedly non-premium compared to other 777 operators offerings. Even business class looked pretty basic, especially the ‘pairs’ of seats on the sides of the cabin (every other row) where it looked as if the window seat occupant would have to climb over their fellow passenger to reach the aisle. This was an 11 hour flight and we were well fed and watered throughout; there is a snack area in the middle section of the economy cabins and this isn’t just about snacks; we were treated to repeatedly stocked good quality sandwiches, amazing chocolate chip cookies, Swiss chocolate, nuts, crisps, drinks and Swiss Ricola sweets. It really was like going back 30 years to the way long haul economy used to be! Two decent meals, ice cream three hours out from Zurich and Swiss chocolate before landing-nice! The crew were superb; very friendly, went out of their way to help & genuinely seemed to be enjoying their jobs; so good to see and made a massive difference to the enjoyment of a long flight in a sardine can-feel cabin. I have never flown Swiss long haul before, so I may have just got lucky with this crew, but if all crews are like this, then Swiss are doing something right, that's for sure. Toilets were kept clean throughout and drinks were always on hand from flight attendants walking up and down the aisles. Boarding was shambolic; for some reason Swiss boarded economy from the front of the cabin first, working backwards by ‘group’. No surprise then that boarding took an age for those of us sat at the back of the cabin, as we waited for those at the front of economy (who boarded first) to sit down and stow bags. Why Swiss board economy from the front is beyond me; makes no sense at all, but just slows down the whole boarding process and it took almost 10 minutes from boarding to get to my seat (47G). Unimpressed to see single use earphones supplied, especially given the amount of sustainability propaganda fed to us on the IFE system (and particularly so on my next short haul flight from Zurich to Heathrow); hardy sustainable Swiss! Were it not for the dreadfully cramped Swiss 777 cabin, I would be actively seeking out Swiss for long haul travel given the great crew/service, but if I can get on an A380 or a 9 abreast 777 I would always opt for that, as these 10 abreast 777 cabins are just too cramped & the Swiss cabin has to be has to be one of the most cramped economy 777 cabins out there, so I would actively avoid it in future.",1,7,P Holt,2023-09-22,yes,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,Bangkok to Zurich,September 2023,3,5,3,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines
"""incompetence in training or a lack of care""","Due to a passenger count discrepancy between ground staff and cabin crew the LHR-ZRH flight was delayed by 1h 20m, resulting in a missed connection at ZRH. The airline accommodated us on a much later flight with a different airline, arriving 5h 55m later than planned on timetable and 6h 10m in actual. On my return I contacted Customer Services and claimed for EU/261/2004. This seems a pretty clear case of delayed arrival resulting from operational issues. To my surprise I got a reply from the airline telling me I must contact the operating airline for this. As far as I am aware I was seated in an A321neo owned and operated by the airline. When I queried twice their definition of operating airline I first received a bland automatic response, hoping to welcome me back in the near future and second an email informing me the case was closed. Extremely disappointed by their customer services case handling, probably even more so than the delay, as it contains incorrect flight numbers and dates and shows incompetence in training or a lack of care in responding.

"""dumped their passengers onto other airlines""","Flew with SWISS as I wanted to go to Dubai and their fare was the cheapest available. That along with travelling with a new airline via a stopover in a place I've never been added to my enthusiasm for this journey. Getting to Dubai was relatively stress free, except for the wallet busting food prices in Zurich. Note to transit passengers passing through Zurich, pack your own food or pay exceptional amounts for staple foods you take for granted back for home. Coming back from Dubai where things got interesting. Boarded the plane at Dubai as normal, then we were informed the place had developed a technical fault, resulting in the planes computers needed to be reset. All power to the plane turned off. Then we were told there was an issue with the GPS and the airline not having the relevant clearance to enter specific countries airspace en route to Zurich. Periodic updates occurred during the nearly 3 hrs they kept us on the plane, on the runway and still in Dubai. Finally after 3 hours, they announced the flight was cancelled and we were to contact the transfer desk. The queue was long but somebody prompted me to check my emails where i saw Swiss had rebooked me on another flight with Emirates, flying to Geneva and then on to Zurich. So I had to take 3 flights instead of two. Waiting to obtain a new boarding pass and rechecking my luggage with Emirates was stressful as queues were long and chaotic with no order to anything. As with these sorts of situations, it is those that shout loudest that get things done. No visible or practical support from any swiss air staff only an email. They merely dumped their passengers onto other airlines to sort. Eventually got to Zurich where i tried to reason with the SWISS staff if I could be booked on to an earlier London flight at no cost due as a gesture of goodwill for the additional time i was made to wait in Dubai. They were not having it and ended up waiting in Zurich for my next day London flight. A new situation for me but the support from SWISS could've been so much better.

"""forced to buy another suitcase""","The service itself was decent, but this is the second time that I experience great inconvenience on a Swiss flight.  The most recent incident was last March when I flew out of Athens and arrived in Singapore where I received a damaged suitcase. I filed a claim and was advised that the suitcase would be picked up from my hotel and repaired. I pointed out that Singapore was the first stop of a Far East trip with 6 stops, so my suitcase was badly needed in 4 days when I would take off again to continue. The suitcase was picked up from the hotel 2 days later, only to be returned in 20 minutes advising that they did not have the necessary parts to repair it. The local claims handling agency told me that they would not be further involved and I needed to sort this out with Swiss directly. As I needed to continue my trip I was forced to buy a new suitcase and throw out the damaged one. I tried to find as close a match to my original suitcase in size, make and quality. The replacement cost was SGD 329 or roughly 230 Euro. Having kept pictures I took the matter up upon my return with Swiss, filing a follow up claim. They re-directed me to another claims handling agency who, 2 months and numerous reminders later advised they would compensate me with 40 Euro! Alternatively they offered to pay for the repair cost but I advised them that the suitcase had been disposed as I could not carry it along on all my subsequent flights. They then increased their offer to €61.98. Bottom line is that my bag arrived broken and Swiss was unable to either repair it or provide an alternative for me to continue my trip. I was forced to buy another suitcase and realize that a discount would be reasonable but 73% I believe is insulting. I was forced by Swiss' inability to provide alternatives to dispose of the broken bag and buy a new one so I find it unreasonable that I have to bear that cost.",1,3,Adamantios Catsambis,2023-09-03,no,Business Class,Business,Athens to Singapore via Zurich,March 2023,3,3,2,2,3,Swiss International Air Lines

That didn't happen. 24 hours after our arrival we found out, by me initiating contact, that my bag had been found but we would have to pick it up at the airport, at our cost, as it was too late to deliver. That was the first 2 examples of poor service. We picked my bag up and saw the huge number of missing bags they had. Some seemed to have contact details but we still in the lost area. How they managed to lose both our bags, to obviously different locations, is quite remarkable. They provided a website to tell us the status of the lost bags. Over the next few days we checked regularly but nothing changed. It still showed my bag as awaiting pickup which was wrong. Numbers that we were given to ring either didn't answer or were wrong. Customer support was useless, they only care about bookings. The best offer we had was to get a number in America to ring (we are Australians in Europe.) No use at all. Eventually we left it with our cruise director on the Viking ship we were on. They were chasing other bags as well. After a week we were told the bag was being flown to Frankfurt and would be sent to the ship from there. That never happened. I suspect it was sent, sat there and then returned. The next update was it was going to Munich. We had no further advice about it. After Viking eventually confirmed it was there they dispatched a driver to pick it up and bring it back to the closest port. They then put it on a ship that would meet us in Vienna. After 14 days my wife got her bag, no thanks to Swiss air. I lost track of the number of calls and emails we and Viking made trying to get the bag. At on stage Viking spent over 4 hours on the phone trying to get answer. They we just totally unresponsive to nearly all calls and emails and the website updates were appalling and mostly non-existent. If not for Viking sending a car to Munich we would not have received the bag at all. We had our emails on our bag tags but that was no help.

"""Dissatisfying Experience""","Dissatisfying Experience - A Once Top-Tier Airline's Downfall. I regret to say that my recent experience with the airline, which was once considered a top-tier airline, left much to be desired. Despite the hefty price tag, the overall service fell short of expectations, leading to a disappointing journey. Initially drawn in by the airline's prestigious reputation and high-end image, I expected a level of service commensurate with the cost. However, my experience quickly took a downturn when I encountered various issues throughout my trip. Flight delays became an all-too-common occurrence, leading to inconvenient disruptions to my travel plans. Additionally, the seating arrangement was far from comfortable, lacking the expected space and amenities that one would expect from a premium airline. Moreover, the in-flight services were underwhelming, failing to meet the standards I had come to associate with top-tier carriers. The lacklustre customer service only exacerbated the situation, as staff seemed disinterested and unresponsive to passengers' needs. Sadly, it appears that the airline's emphasis on providing a low-cost service came at the expense of maintaining the high-quality experience they were once known for. As a result, the company's reputation seemed to have declined, and many passengers, like myself, began seeking alternatives from more competitive and value-driven airlines. It's disheartening to witness the downfall of what was once a leading player in the aviation industry. I sincerely hope that Swiss takes these criticisms constructively and endeavours to reinstate the excellence it was once celebrated for. Striking a balance between affordability and premium service is crucial for their revival in the highly competitive market. In conclusion, while the airline may still bear the vestiges of its former glory, the current experience leaves much to be desired.

Furthermore, the flight itself was far from satisfactory. The seats were uncomfortable, leaving me feeling cramped and restless throughout the entire duration of the flight. The lack of legroom was particularly unbearable, making it nearly impossible to find a comfortable position to sit in. Additionally, the in-flight entertainment was severely lacking, with a limited selection of outdated movies and TV shows. It felt like a step back in time rather than a modern travel experience. To make matters worse, the food served onboard was tasteless and unappetizing. The meals lacked variety and were of subpar quality. I was left feeling unsatisfied and hungry, which only added to my overall dissatisfaction with the airline. Lastly, the airline's punctuality was highly questionable. My flight experienced a significant delay, causing me to miss an important connection. This lack of punctuality and disregard for passengers' time is simply unacceptable. All in all, my experience with SWISS airlines was marred by poor customer service, uncomfortable seating, lackluster entertainment options, unappetizing food, and significant delays. I would strongly advise against choosing this airline if you value a pleasant and hassle-free travel experience. There are much better options available that provide superior service and comfort.""",1,1,Mladen Gueorguiev,2023-07-10,no,Business Class,Couple Leisure,Boston to Frankfurt via Zurich,July 2023,1,1,1,1,1,Swiss International Air Lines
"""worst airline I have ever flown with""","I can confidently say that Swiss International Air Lines is the worst airline I have ever flown with. They have deleted my return ticket because I asked for a date change without my permission and didn't even inform me. I called them a few days before my original return date to see if I could change my return flight to 2 days earlier than planned, they said yes and went ahead and changed my ticket as well as sent me a confirmation email with the new dates. AA few hours later I received an email saying that my credit card used for rebooking charge didn't process. I gave them another call and this time the customer service rep said that I actually can't change my ticket and I would need to fly back during the original return date. A day before the original return flight I couldn't login to see my booking using the reference number so I called them again to learn that my return ticket was 'deleted'. They said because I asked for a change and it was not possible there were two booking under my name and they cancelled both. They robbed me off the return flight that I payed months in advance. I was told by the customer service rep this time that I could rebook my deleted return flight with a penalty and the fare difference if I preferred ... it is unbelievable but this is what they told me. When I got frustrated I was told by the customer service rep that maybe I should 'go away and think a little bit'. I ended but buying an entirely different one way ticket home that cost me over $1,000 in addition to the $1,900 roundtrip ticket that I already paid for with Swiss.

I had the special seafood Month, and the seafood starter and the seafood pasta were just amazing, as the rest of the dishes, which I choose from the regular menu. Worth mentioning the cheese plate as another highlight for cheese lovers. For breakfast I choose the Quiche, which was one of the best dishes I enjoyed on all my flights.

Normal price has been $750. In econ+ section of 50 seats, only 4 were occupied.  Staff was very attentive. Food? I stopped eating on Swiss flights years ago because it was consistently: Chicken or pasta. Instead I buy Spanish ham and a good cheese and a pastry at the deli at Zurich airport to carry on.

Not what we had hoped for in business, but since Swiss Air, Austrian are controlled by Lufthansa it’s about what you expect.

"""Service was abysmal""","Flew Business Class on an 777-300 plane from Singapore to Zürich and then changed to another one to fly from Zurich to the U.S. While Swiss has been my favorite non-U.S. carrier, both flights were awful relative to aircraft and service. A few lowlights: Seats are very uncomfortable and do not lie flat. Cushions are weak and they are too narrow. Some aisle seats have no sides. Window seats with 2 seat configurations are difficult to enter or leave. Controls for seat positions are few and placed near where you easily can press one by accident. Storage near or under seats is very limited, it was hard to find a place for shoes or a purse nearby. The SIN-ZRH 777 plane was not very clean and smelt. The other 777 aircraft seemed very new, and was clean, but my seat did not adjust downward as much as my companion’s seat, poor construction and quality checking. Washrooms were like in Economy. Meals and beverages reflected cost-cutting, and I’ve flown Swiss business for decades. Cheap new plastic trays are used, limited refills were offered, galley snacks on these long-flights were popcorn or crisps in small bags and a few small candy bars. Wines and liquors appeared downgraded, as were the menus. Meat was tough. Deserts were ordinary. Service was abysmal. First meal on a 10 hour flight was served three hours after departure. Service on the Singapore flight didn’t offer nuts or anything on the side with drinks. My companion ordered sorbet from a menu, but was given ice cream even though both were on the menu. When she asked to exchange, the attendant told her there was no sorbet left. However, I was served 10 minutes later, inexcusable for a couple sitting together. I then received sorbet from a different attendant. I, however, had asked for ice cream but I was told now there was no ice cream. Yet later I saw two other persons receiving ice cream. Sorbet or ice cream is no big deal. But due to the contradictions either or both flight attendants lied or were too lazy to care. Neither is excusable and both cross lines. Cabin crew was not friendly, but the ZRH ground crew wins a bad conduct prize. As the couple in front of us were boarding, the gate attendant turned to a colleague, rolled her eyes and said disparagingly to her colleague “Americans”. I don’t believe she knew we heard her. ﻿",1,3,E Bergman,2023-02-23,no,Business Class,Couple Leisure,Singapore to Miami via Zurich,February 2023,1,3,3,2,2,Swiss International Air Lines

I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort of seat 8A and the surrounding space. I found the business class configuration economical compared to companies like Singapore airlines. The food served was tasty and nicely styled. The staff was very attentive during the flight and fulfilled any requests. The interior showed the older age of the aircraft.

"""Overall an average experience""","Overall an average experience. Starting off with the good things: The 2-3 layout of the airbus A220 makes people traveling alone in economy substantially more convenient than other offerings in the A320s or the 737s with the ability to sit on the 2 side so you are only next to one other person. The seat was relatively new, there was a complimentary bottle of water and a little chocolate was offered (see photo). Now the downsides, as a full carrier charging full carrier prices and in a somewhat new aircraft, the lack of in-seat power points of USB ports was disappointing. Other competitors on this route all offer some kind of in-seat charging options (even on AF's old A319s) so it's a big downside for Swiss. Furthermore, the drink options was limited to only a bottle of water, nothing else. It would be fair to expect some more options offered by the crew in addition to just a bottle of water, especially for a morning flight like this one.

I wanted a lay flat seat but I've had no experience with international travel until now so I didn't know which seats would do that. I saw that I could bid for an upgrade to premium economy. My wife and I were both flying and the minimum bid for the upgrade for 2 seats was about $700 USD. Before I submitted my bid I called their customer service line to see if those seats lay flat. The customer service agent put me on hold to verify if they do or do not. When she came back on the line she said “yes they do”. I reverified with her by saying just to confirm, the premium economy seat lay all the way back, they lay flat, and she said the premium economy seats lay flat. I thanked her for her time and submitted my bid. I found out on the flight that the seats do not lay flat. I submitted a complaint to their customer service and asked for a refund for the upgrade since I was lied to and since the lay flat seats, which I did not get, were my sole purpose for upgrading. They refused to refund the $700 USD. This is completely unacceptable.

"""the worst long haul flight experiences of my life""","Both directions, South Africa to Brazil via Zurich were some of the worst long haul flight experiences of my life. If it’s avoidable I will never fly Swiss again, and I fly a lot. First of all, the app does not work correctly. You cannot even check in on the app, or choose seats, or add baggage. I had to use the Lufthansa app to check in and choose seats on my way to Brazil. On the way back not even that worked. The website also gives you an error when you check in. On my way back I had to check in with LATAM because I flew Rio to São Paulo on a LATAM partner flight to start the trip, but they would only let me check in for the first flight, so I had to recheck-in at the counter on my 2 hour layover - so I got a terrible seat for my long haul flights. Also the seats on the South Africa to Zurich and back flights are insanely tiny for an 11 hour flight, the smallest worst seats I’ve maybe ever had in a plane. To make it even worse the window seats have a 15 cm gap between them and the wall/window so you can’t lean on the wall (the whole point of a window seat). Worst food I’ve ever been served on an airplane, and that includes cheap African and Asian airlines. On top of that, they overbooked the SP to Zurich flight, and begged me to volunteer for compensation. I said no at first but told them I might consider it. They approached me after and really pushed me to say yes because they didn’t have enough volunteers. Then after taking my seat and boarding everyone else, announced my name on the loud speaker and told me actually I needed to get on the flight. At that point I had already asked a friend to come get me from the airport so we could spend the evening together and I had to call them off. They gave me a middle emergency row seat with no seat in front, so there was no place to put anything, no book, no headphones etc. Because I was the last person on the plane the overhead bins were full (they didn’t keep space for the emergency row people). The flight attendant told me I had to put my bag in business class. I told her I need access to it if I cannot have anything out of the bag for take off per the emergency exit rules, plus no seat in front of me. She started yelling at me she didn’t want to be on the flight and was tired of moving peoples bags around and it wasn’t her problem. She literally said to me “I don’t even want to be on this flight so you having access to your things is not my problem.” I was kind of in shock, and then another passenger volunteered to have move their bag to under the seat in front of them.",1,1,L Jackson,2023-02-02,no,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,Rio de Janeiro to Johannesburg via Zurich,January 2023,1,1,1,1,1,Swiss International Air Lines

"""they can't see any mistake from their side""","I have always been a loyal fan and guest of Swiss and have always been more than satisfied with their service. Unfortunately, my experience with my last booking to the US clearly clouded my opinion. As always, I booked my flight to Chicago via the Swiss Smartphone App on August 30, 2022 to visit my fiancé. I wanted to take the opportunity right away to bring our two cats over. I knew that this is easily possible with Swiss and that I simply had to call the hotline after booking to reserve the places for the cats in the luggage compartment. When I received the booking confirmation, I found that the flight was operated by United Airlines, which was unfortunately hardly visible in the app. However, I figured if Swiss partners with United Airlines, the policies and services will be the same. I then called United Airlines to reserve the space for the cats in the luggage compartment. I was quite disappointed to find out that United Airlines no longer takes cats in the luggage compartment. My disappointment was enormous because I had booked a flight that is of no use to me. I then called the Swiss hotline and I had to book a new outbound flight with Swiss with additional rebooking costs of around CHF 270. About a week later I call again to make sure the cats are booked and they tell me they are on the Chicago to Zurich flight, which was wrong! After several calls i finally managed it to have them booked on the flight from Zurich to Chicago and not vice versa. The day before departure I went to the pet store to buy a suitable transport box for the cats and called the Swiss Hotline from the shop to make sure I was buying the right transport box. The person on the hotline assured me that soft transport boxes with a steel frame are also permitted for cats. So I chose a model for CHF 120. When I checked in the next day at Zurich Airport, I was told that these boxes were not permitted and I had to buy a new one for CHF 140.00 on the spot and had no other choice than throw the other one away. I had additional costs totaling CHF 530 for this trip, which I could have avoided if Swiss had communicated correctly and the information on the app were more visible. Afterwards I have filed a complaint and i got a short and impersonal answer back that they can't see any mistake from their side.

We got water and chocolate and our child got toys (they tried also to give to him sweets but we refused). The plane was clean and the staff showed us respect. In Milan we had to wait like 5min close to the plane to get our baby trolley. The shuttle bus was waiting for us. The crew got out from the plane and they tried to help to find it. They felt frustrated because we had to wait so much (and the bus full with passengers was waiting for us) and they apologized. Back in Oslo, I found out that my luggage got a little damage. In the airport, I spoke with them from customer service (baggage service) and they apologized and gave me the chance to chose (from a website) a new suitcase for free. In my opinion, their focus is on the customer. It was a nice experience and for sure we will travel again with them.",0,10,Alex Iacoban,2022-10-18,yes,Economy Class,Family Leisure,Oslo to Milan via Zurich,October 2022,5,4,5,5,5,Swiss International Air Lines
"""Dinner is served on one tray""","While I had a really good outbound flight on LH, the service on my return flight from Sao Paulo to Zurich was a disappointment. They don't offer aperitif with a drink run and nuts or nibbles before dinner. Dinner is served on one tray with all courses coming together at the same time. That's not business class and once you have finished the starter, the main dish is cold. Also no choice of breads and just two bites of cheese with no crackers. It seemed that cabin crew wanted to get the service done as quickly as possible, but it's an 11 hour flight departing at 6pm, so no need to rush or getting people to sleep soon. The breakfast service on Swiss is decent with many options to choose from. I ended up with hardly any sleep, partly because of quite a bumpy flight (that's not Swiss' fault of course), but also the seats are not well designed, quite narrow and uncomfortable to sleep on. Connection to Amsterdam is on European business class, i.e. narrow seat pitch, hard backrest and just a small snack to eat. Lounge in Zurich was incredibly crowded around 11am, I could not find a place to sit down and left again after having only a glass of water standing in the corner like many other travellers.",1,4,C Garsten,2022-10-14,no,Business Class,Solo Leisure,Sao Paulo to Amsterdam via Zurich,October 2022,3,3,2,4,3,Swiss International Air Lines

"""never fly Lufthansa or Swiss Air again""","I don't even know where to begin with the nightmare that is Swiss Air / Lufthansa. No one informed me when I booked wheelchair assistance for my mom at the time of booking our ticket, that she could not sit in the row with extra legroom and receive wheelchair assistance through the airport. The Swiss Air employees at LAX refused her wheelchair assistance, so my 82 year old mom who had back surgery earlier this year, had to walk all the way through LAX to our gate.  Swiss Air sent me 3 emails during our trip, changing our seats each time, due to ""equipment changes."" We purchased our tickets 3 months in advance, in order to ensure that we had one aisle and one window seat with extra legroom for each flight, due to her history of blood clots in the legs. And without any thought, they removed us from our seats and stuck us in middle seats with no legroom. I spent approximately 3+ hours on the phone, of which I was disconnected 5 times. Swiss Air told me they could not help me with my seats and that I would have to deal with Lufthansa. I called Lufthansa and they said they would NOT help me because I purchased the tickets on Swiss Air so I would have to deal with Swiss Air. A continuous loop of BS and unaccountability. No one would help us with our ever-changing seat assignments. We even asked if we could change flights for our return back to LAX, and they said the fare difference would be $1350 per ticket. The day before our return flight back to Los Angeles, we received yet another email stating that my mom had no seat on the flight, AT ALL. When I called, I was subjected to one rude Swiss Air rep after another, all saying ""sorry for the inconvenience, but there is nothing they can do"" and that we would have to wait until we got to the airport in Milan. Swiss Air said that extra legroom fees are non refundable and they would not be able to refund the money from the seats that we originally purchased and were REPEATEDLY STOLEN from us. So let me get this straight. We paid WAYYYY too much money in the first place to purchase our original tickets 3 months in advance on through Swiss Air's website, paying extra for each segment in order to have extra legroom. Then Swiss Air changes our seat assignments 3 times, each time to a middle seat with no extra legroom.  And to top it off, Swiss Air tells us we have to go through Lufthansa and Lufthansa tells us we HAVE to go through Swiss Air. I was so disgusted with both Swiss Air and Lufthansa  that we finally gave up and purchased one-way tickets home on Emirates, which was the airline we should have flown to begin with.

There’s no foot rest and it’s a sliding shell seat which doesn’t actually work. Not worth the money. Economy looked like a nightmare. The food in premium was very good.

"""a very bad customer experience""","On last July 14th my wife and children (3yo and 5yo) flew from Vienna to Bordeaux with Austrian, booked with Swiss Airlines. Originally the flight was scheduled at 9:35 in the morning, but they were not able to onboard due to a booking issue on Swiss Air's side. I accompanied them to the booking counter, where they had to wait for about an hour before someone helped us. A new booking had to be issued, and flying was not possible until 15:00. The new flights had then both delays - and my family finally landed in Bordeaux at 00:30 on July 15th, whereas the arrival was originally planned at 14:05 the day before. There is a compensation for these kind of cases, named ""EC261-2004"". Therefore I reported the issue to Swiss Air on their website. I only got an answer 2 weeks later, stating that the problem was not Swiss Air's fault, but occurred because of air traffic controller regulation. But it DOES qualify as a situation covered by EC261-2004. The booking was changed at the last minute by the company AND the flights had delays. Therefore I responded asking for a better answer, but the lady keeps turning me down. I then decided to call the customer service directly as it should be easier to clarify things over the phone, right ? So. I called and had to wait for more than 1 hour 10 minutes, with the worst voicemail I've ever heard. It really sounds like they are trying to discourage people! So, after 1 hour 10 minutes I finally got to speak to a lady and explained the whole story. I was quite angry at this point, and she recognized that we should receive a compensation. She then told me she was not responsible for this (seriously?) and gave me another e-mail address which I should contact. I sent an e-mail to this other address, more than 2 weeks ago (on August 29th), and all I got so far was an automatic response. There was a link in this mail, that should redirect to the contact list of Lufthansa's support. Guess what happens when clicking on the link ? I get this lovely message : ""You don't have permission to access this resource on the server."" This has got really tiring at this point. I feel like I have to fight for something that Swiss Air is deliberately ignoring because they don't want to take responsibility. This is a very bad customer experience, and I would definitely recommend not flying with them, because it just shows how much they don't care about their customers, let alone their poor support staff which is completely under water.",1,2,A Naseure,2022-09-14,no,Economy Class,Family Leisure,Vienna to Bordeaux,July 2022,4,4,2,4,2,Swiss International Air Lines
"""a long series of disappointments""","I flew Swiss Air because they offered a good price for my return trip from Florence to Geneva and because of their good reputation. However, my flight was disappointing from start to finish. Beginning with their mobile app, I was not able to link my flight to it or even check in on their website, even though I had had no problems with these functions with other airlines just a week previously. Then I received an email the day before that my seat had been changed, though the email did not give a reason and there was no link to find out what my new seat was. I arrived at the Florence airport early because I couldn't check in online and it was then (only a few hours before) that I found out that my flight was delayed, first by 15 minutes, then by an hour and 15 minutes, with no explanation and no clear indication of the gate until after the original flight time. When I realized that I would miss my connecting flight in Zurich, I went to the Swiss Air clerk to ask what could be done and she told me that I had already been rescheduled for a new flight (for which I had not received an email). After asking more than once how I would board my new connecting flight without a correct boarding pass, she printed one for me. Our flight from Florence to Zurich finally left, 1.5 hours late. The only explanation given was that the previous Swiss Air plane had been delayed. After arriving in Zurich, most of the food shops were closed and I had to walk all the way to the other end of the airport for my next gate. The 10:35 pm flight was again delayed until 10:50 pm and we didn't actually take off until 11:15 pm. Once again, no explanations were given. And when we finally boarded, the clerk forced me to check my bag as being too large even though that had not been a problem on the previous flight, and even though I saw at least 2 other passengers with bags the same size as mine, who were not forced to check their bags. I had decided to limit my belongings to a carry-on bag and not check a bag so that I wouldn't need to wait at baggage claim. Because I was forced to do this, I was delayed and had to wait 30 minutes for my bus home. I did not arrive home until almost 1:00 am. I should have been home by around 10:15 pm.

Despite having paid for an emergency exit seat, I was assigned a regular seat far back, from what I could tell. I called the online check-in service for assistance, but one would be hard pressed to find a more clueless agent. Terms such as ‘emergency exit row’, ‘aircraft type’ and ‘seating configuration’ were completely foreign to him. I tried to explain them to him, but was met with utter incomprehension. I then called the regular call centre number, but hung up after 20 minutes of being told my call would be answered ‘shortly’. I finally went in person to the city ticketing office, where they confirmed that ‘having done their utmost to assign me an appropriate seat’, SWISS had decided to assign the emergency exit row to business class. Even Edelweiss, Switzerland’s leisure airline, offers you a snack, but not SWISS that is ostensibly a full-service airline. Paying close to CHF 500 for a short-haul economy class flight still doesn’t entitle you to a bite to eat.

We left the gate at Zurich at 9:30 AM local time.

I turned it off after this time as it was clear I was not important. It was 2 hoursS after our neighboring passengers had been served, two flight attendants showed up to clear away the meal trays which by now littered the cabin floors and other areas as passengers had gotten frustrated with having no outlet for their trays and garbage.

"""going downhill in terms of service quality""","I am a long time Swiss frequent flyer (Senator Status) and I have to say that Swiss is losing many of the aspects which made it my preferred airline. On my most recent trip, while the flight and in-flight service were fine, the situation with luggage was completely different. After paying $70 per piece of luggage (fair enough - I did book an economy light fare which does not include luggage allowance,) one of our suitcases got stuck in Zurich. I have placed Apple AirTags in all my luggage, because I simply do not trust the airlines. When I filed the claim, I was able to show the airport staff the exact location of the missing suitcase (based on the aforementioned AirTag) - however in their system they had no information and they refused to note down any details. It took 6 days before the luggage was finally delivered. In that time I bought a few items to be able to make it through the 6 days with my family of 5 - but the airline refuses to reimburse beyond 100 EUR - and refuses to refund the fee for the service not rendered. (I am not bitter about paying and it was transparently disclosed by the airline - I am bitter for paying for something which I did not receive.) Additionally, my efforts to contact customer service were ignored (daily email to the provided email address requesting updates), unanswered (literally nobody answered the phone number provided), and when I finally did get through to an agent they ended up hanging up on me. This is by far the worst experience I have had with Swiss - and despite this, I would still recommend them, but they are clearly going downhill in terms of service quality.",0,5,Jose Ordinas Lewis,2022-08-04,yes,Economy Class,Family Leisure,New York to Palma de Mallorca via Zurich,July 2022,3,4,1,4,3,Swiss International Air Lines
"""suitcases were delivered to us 3 days later""","Seated in the airplane, our child, who was by the window seat, exclaimed looking outside: ""Look, our suitcases are there!"". And indeed, our suitcases (which had colorful coverings which made them extremely recognizable) were on an airport trolley right by the airplane. And at that moment, the captain announced: ""Cabin crew, arm the slides"". Almost immediately we observed the workers on the airfield starting to cover the trolleys with our suitcases with some kind of fabric. I rushed to the flight attendant: ""These are definitely our suitcases there right by the airplane. Would we not load them into the airplane?"" The flight attendant promised to check with the captain and went to the cockpit at once. Returning back, the flight attendant  replied: ""We are sorry. These are your suitcases, yes. We were given a time window to take off now and we don't have time to load your luggage into the airplane"". Two other flight attendants  witnessed our situation of total helplessness. We merely had to observe our luggage staying behind and comforting our child the way we could. Throughout the flight, I kept asking myself these questions: *It is minus 22 at our destination, and our child's warm clothes are not coming with us. Do they think that treatment of the passengers is normal?  I am the organizer of my father's funeral in a few days upon arrival, and my clothes for the ceremony are left behind as well. Upon landing, there were around 15 families in total including us who did not receive their luggage, apparently all from the trolleys we observed being left behind. Of our 3 suitcases we registered for the flight, 2 were left behind. Each of these families had to spend additional 2 hours registering the lost baggage, most of them with children like us, already in the late hour. At some point, we observed the whole crew of the Swiss flight just passing by. They had their suitcases with them, so why should they at all care? Fast forward, after numerous phone calls to the airport to check the status of our luggage, the suitcases were delivered to us 3 days later at 2 a.m. in the night. That was the earliest time they could deliver our luggage, but I agreed on that and spent the sleepless night, because my father's funeral was next morning and I desperately needed the contents of my suitcase by then. As a conclusion from our side, we are not using Swiss these days for our summer vacation.

"""discover my case had not arrived""","I flew in late June from Milan to Geneva via Zurich on Swiss. I checked in my case to Geneva, my end point. The Milan departure was late (maybe 30 mins) to board; as was the Zurich flight was late to board - approx. 45 mins - and we then sat for close to 75 mins on the tarmac. A series of refuelling and other delays causing them to lose their allotted slots. Not great but these things do happen. After asking specifically for an isle seat, I ended up in the last row, middle seat, blank wall, no window. Jammed in while we sat on the tarmac (I'm 6 foot 3).  I arrived in Geneva to discover my case had not arrived. To arrive in Geneva and wait around aimlessly for almost an hour at the carousel is a trying experience for anyone - but particularly so in my case, as this occurred after a cumulative 36 hours of travel from Sydney. No Swiss rep to engage with. No one to help. Then the long queues at the lost baggage office. This caused huge inconvenience as I had all my hiking gear in my suitcase. I was over in Geneva / Chamonix only for less than 6 days – so the loss was both very costly and very inconvenient. The case finally arrived back in Sydney 2 weeks later. But no home delivery - I had to go to the airport to collect it. No contact from Swiss; no apology. But the real frustration is that Swiss has:  no reliable 'push updates' on its website regarding the status of your bag and its expected time of arrival (ETA) - nothing - simply a void of information after receiving a call a week earlier to say the bag had bene found. After that a complete vacuum of information. No accessible channels to complain though - no email, no landline / helpline, and nonsensical/unworkable website, and  no accessible channel to submit and arrange a refund. Quite clearly this is an airline that doesn't want to be contacted. Their website makes it impossible to lodge claims – it feels almost deliberate – or at worst a terrible user experience, and their chatbot doesn’t work.I am not a happy customer and Swiss Air has not covered themselves in glory by any stretch.

We had no one to talk to and tried vain to contact them numerous times by phone and at the airport (the local agent). Our holiday ended up stressful and frustrating and was totally ruined. Now we are back home and one suitcase has still not been located three weeks later! To add insult to the injury, Swiss customer service (outsourced wherever in Africa and not deserving the name of ""customer service"") told us they won't pay an indemnity for the 7 hours delay as it was caused by a technical fault, and offered EUR 100 for the expenses, even though we spent our entire holiday without any personal effects!

I had originally booked to fly two weeks previously but had been informed that the flight had been cancelled a couple of weeks before departure. The rebooking process had been pretty stressful due to extremely long wait times when calling the airline's customer service center in Tokyo. I was on hold for at least 40 minutes. After rescheduling I noticed that the ticket was printed with my name in the wrong order which was partially my fault as I had booked the ticket on the Japanese site and in Japan they put names in the opposite order. I called up customer service again, was on hold again for 30 plus minutes again and spoke to a very unhelpful person. I was told that I would need to pay 3500 yen (about $30) to change this. The woman on the phone was rude and unhelpful. I was on the phone for an hour in total. This was not a free phone number so not only did I have to pay to change the ticket but also for a 2 long phone calls.

Check in was smooth and quick and the ground staff were efficient and polite. The plane was perhaps 60% full. Due to the closure of Russian airspace the plane flew east over Alaska which means the journey to Zurich was about 15 hours long. The seat was comfortable. Full complimentary drink service was offered with pretzel bites. The first meal was one of the better economy meals. I chose the Japanese chicken and rice, the rice was well cooked and not dry and the chicken was flavorsome. This was accompanied by cold soba noodles, a matcha dessert and roll and cheese. The second meal was pretty terrible, a veggie bake thing which resembled a split white sauce with some random veggies (one bite was enough).

The flight itself was short and uneventful. There was no meal service, but passengers could order small snacks. I had a very tasty pulled beef sandwich.

On our flight back, Checking in night before, we discovered our VCE to ZUR flight leg was cancelled. No email notification, just relied on me checking my booking details on the website. Arranged a flight the next day, no offer of hotel accom. Went to VCE airport as well to ask for hotel accom, the check in desk told us to take it up with Swiss via email and keep receipts! Terrible. Get on our rearranged flight the next day, only to find the VIE to BKK leg was delayed so that we now miss connecting flight to Sydney. No one at Vienna airport seemed interested to help, they said 'sort it out at Bangkok'. Called Swiss via phone, and they said that they can't do anything. I pointed out to Austrian / Swiss that we can't leave Bangkok airport as we don't have the necessary Covid related pass. The Austrian Airlines person seemed completely indifferent. So now I'm wondering when I will actually get home to Sydney. And not one offer from Swiss (or their codeshare Austrian) for any compensation, even for a simple sandwich.

I argued that I've done this trip many times before and enjoyed up to a 1 year visa-free stay. I pulled up immigration information from the web, published by the Philippine Embassy in Paris. I showed old passport stamps of Philippine arrival wherein my date of arrival (and maximum date allowed to stay) are clearly indicated on the stamp (like I said, 1 year visa-free). But the check in staff were not convinced. I had to rebook an earlier return within the 30 day limit. I was angry but I thought I would be able to resolve the issue later. Several times that morning, I was told to remove myself from the vicinity of the check-in counter to allow them to serve other passengers. I was the only Business Class passenger in the counter as far as I knew, all the rest were lining up in the economy queue. The station manager  made me feel like a piece of dirt. Upon arrival in MNL, I was given the usual 1 year visa-free stay.

There was no ""Welcome on board"" greeting and smile but thats ok. Plane was clean except under the IFE tv screen, there was this thick layer of dust which I ended up wiping out. Right after the take off, crew gave out little snack of olive crackers and a whole can of soda, I asked for diet sprite and i was told straight up that only coke zero is available, still ok. Within an hour of take off, dinner was served, main portion was really small (two thin layers of beef and carrots and mashed potatoes), ample amount of salad, small dessert and two rounds of bread roll and drinks. Coffee or tea was served after dinner and then crew just disappeared. One particular crew member seems like she was forced to do this job, her attitude was very up-tight (take it or leave it), rest of the crew also seems like not really interested in doing their job.

Why not send the flight out on time and clean up the mess after, so people can make their connecting flight? Crew on board was lovely and food was good. Arrived to Zurich 40 minutes late, this left me with 20 minutes to make it to the flight to Kyiv. Luckily, the flight to Kyiv was delayed 20 minutes, so this gave me 40 minutes total to transfer. I felt relieved and was sure all was well. Boy, was I wrong! In Kyiv I received an SMS that my luggage was left in Zurich! How is it that I was able to make it to my connecting flight, but my luggage was not? Zurich is not even that big of an airport. The bag was put on the flight to Kyiv the next day, and I was told they'd set up a delivery for me. Another day passes and no word of my luggage being delivered to me.

"""This airline has the worst customer service I have encountered in a long time""","This review concerns post-flight customer service. I flew with Swiss Air on Aug 4 from Tel Aviv to San Francisco via Zurich. Since I was dreading the possibility of sitting in a center seat flanked by two strangers during the COVID pandemic, I purchased reserved seating to ensure an aisle seat on both flights. The reservation, for which I paid 70 US dollars, was made already in May. Shortly before the flight Swiss sent me an email informing me that they changed my seat assignment. They did not disclose the position of the reassigned seat, but wrote that they have done their “utmost to assign an adequate seat”. When I boarded the plane, I discovered that they had placed me in a center seat, flanked by two strangers who did not keep their masks on – exactly the scenario I was trying to avoid. On the official SWISS airlines website I see the following: Might SWISS change the seat I reserve in advance, later on? If SWISS has to change your seat reservation, e.g. due to a short-notice change to the aircraft type used, SWISS will do its best to automatically reserve you a new seat in the seat category you have booked. If it is not possible to reserve an equal seat for you, you may apply to receive a Refund of the charge online. Upon arriving to my destination, I filed a request for a refund. I was answered 11 days later by a customer feedback consultant, she flatly refused my claim. When I politely pointed to her that the official website states that I am entitled to a refund she gave this rude answer: “SWISS has responded adequately in your case. I therefore trust in your understanding that this message reflects our final position and that this file is now considered closed.” I was shocked by her response, and asked her for contact information for her supervisor, which she completely ignored. I then tried calling the US customer service phone number. I tried twice, but gave up after waiting for 60 minutes each time.

A good airline tries to make allowances for this, exercising their discretion to be generous. Swiss International is NOT such an airline. I originally booked a light economy ticket leaving on 5/8/21 and needed to change my dates. I couldn't get through on the internet and tried to do so via phone. The person I spoke to on the phone gave me incorrect information. They said the money had not yet been taken for the first ticket, so I could just cancel it and should buy a new ticket. I thought that what they said was correct. I later found that the money for the first ticket had been taken, that I was given the wrong information. That person even suggested I keep both tickets in case the first flights were cancelled. Eventually, just before I flew, I panicked and just asked to have the taxes refunded, not the whole ticket. When I tried to have the issue reconsidered, I was told that no refund would be forthcoming.

"""service onboard has gone down hill""","I like to spoil myself and the family a couple of times a year, selecting Swiss Business Class. This flight was just myself travelling CPH/ZRH/FLR/ZRH/CPH in Business Class. The service onboard has gone down hill, now there is only one cabin member serving Business Class. Furthermore, the procedures have changed now their complete every passenger with meal, drinks, top up etc before moving down the cabin. This means that the last rows are lucky to even get served on a short route. Final leg I had 15 minutes before arrival. I noticed the seat pockets in front of me had not been cleaned but rubbish had been left from the previous passengers. But anyway, here is the absolute shocking experience happened upon arrival. My bag (and the bag of several others) did not arrive. Our flight was over 2 hrs delayed and all onward connections were lost. When I found out that my bag was not onboard, I went to the handling agent (Aviator CPH) desk - empty. No bell to ring, neighbouring desk also empty. So, I had to leave the Airport with no report. Since then I have tried to phone Aviators - no reply. Emailed Swiss in ZRH, no reply. Wrote to the on FB - got a reply to say please fill out this form. However the system says unable to complete this form if you boarded on a self service airport. I didn't self service, I was checked in at the Business Class desk.

I prepared all documents needed to travel prior my flight and when checking in NY JFK I was told that all documents are correct (pcr test) and the dates were valid, as soon as I get to Zurich to catch the Pegasus Airlines  flight to Istanbul I am surprised by the agent notifying me and my friend traveling with me that our PCR tests dates are invalid and that we will miss the original booked flight and unfortunately we did miss the flight and were told we have an option to be booked back to NY which was totally unprofessional and unacceptable. So in order for us to resolve our situation on our own with absolutely horrible assistance from Swiss to find a reasonable solution we had to pay $165 each for a PCR test done in Zurich which results arrive after 5 hours and  we had to book separate tickets to Istanbul $400 by Turkish airlines which happened to be the only flight available that day in order for us to arrive on time for our booked medical operation in Istanbul. So overall the worst experience for me in an airline and unreasonable judgment from Swiss airlines for PCR testing dates which is impossible to get prior the flight, note in US testing centers have a 2-3 business day time frame to get results and our flight was on Sunday (Saturday &sunday are weekends). I contacted the customer service and asked them that we would like as a courtesy for this experience to get a reimbursement for the additional expenses, and their response was it’s the traveler responsibility to make sure all documents are valid, even though they let us travel from JFK to Zurich and they have the final destination and could have told us that our PCR won’t be valid when i get to zurich.

I called Expedia and after multiple tries and long waits got through to a helpful person who told me that Swiss International still had a flight scheduled for the same day from Newark rather than JFK. I told them that would be fine and waited on the phone while Expedia attempted to rebook. This proved impossible because Swiss International would not provide them the code they needed. I gave up and was unable to fly anywhere. After the fact I had repeated contact with Expedia, who unlike Swiss International would answer the phone, about getting a refund, voucher or whatever.

In his  words ‘Wait and see, we might cancel your flight ourselves’. I told him this process was disappointing but that would have to be our option. I am now due to fly tomorrow, and so I checked the website for flight information - There is no clear indication on any flights that have been cancelled. I have received no communications that my flight has been cancelled via email or otherwise. I then rang the company’s UK call centre, only to be told that the flight is no longer running, but more than that, that I myself had requested a cancellation previous to the flight being cancelled by Swiss. As stated above this was not the case, the agent I spoke to would not give me details on which staff member made the cancellation so that I could have it looked into, he would not pass me to a manager so that I could try and resolve the situation, and was completely unhelpful.

I found that their twitter, who used to be very polite and responsive seemed to turn around, they were still responsive but the responses I received were nowhere near polite, such as aggressively asking me if that's all the questions I have. Check in for my 6am flight out of London Heathrow had quite a long line, however it did move quite quickly I was checked in very quickly and invited to use the United club, as our flight oddly left from a B gate, which is not normally used by A320 aircraft. This lounge is nothing significant to write home about, but there were adequate shower facilities and a full english was provided. Once I boarded I found out that half the passengers on the flight were rebooked from London City due to inclement weather, and the flight was quite full. Nevertheless, I received a cold snack and chocolate on this flight. Arrival and transfer into Zürich Kloten airport wasn't something I expected, in a bad way. It seems as if half the security staff had called in sick and therefore there was only one screening lane open. There was also no gold track as advertised on the star alliance website. After buying some cheese and chocolates, I headed to the Senator lounge, and was delighted to find the terrace open! The outdoor terrace is amazing, you can watch planes take off from both active runways, and it was very fun to see some apron activity. Meals at the lounge were also made-to-order, and I wish I could have everything. Everything I tasted was delicious and actually seasoned. The whisky bar was also a delight, the barman recommending different whisky combinations and I was able to enjoy a couple of cocktails and different whiskies. I must say that this barman was the most delightful person I have ever met, and his knowledge of whisky is immaculate. The last leg of the trip was operated by Thai Airways, and I cannot fault that flight. I did want to try Swiss' economy as a lot of people claim they are the best economy in Europe, but unfortunately that flight was full. My baggage was one of ten to come out first, and I was out the door in a matter of minutes after clearing immigration. Overall, Swiss has the most faultless and perfect product in Europe.

Basically it took me 10 hours and lost a full day of business meetings. I got a 250€ that I could only take part in cash because banks don't allow smaller amounts to be taken out.

I spoke to the lady at the counter in Madrid who told me that my luggage has been already found in Zurich and that I should get it this afternoon. I had nothing with me except for the clothes I was wearing. I was surprised that Swiss never offered my any financial assistance to buy some necessities but I figured that since the luggage will arrive this afternoon there was no need to press this further. My luggage did not arrive this afternoon. It did not arrive the next day either. I called the call centre number at least 10 times during this time and they told me that the luggage was still missing. This contradicts what the lady at the counter told me. Furthermore, they gave me an email to escalate this issue. I sent three emails and never got a reply from them to this day. I also lodged a complained on the Swiss airlines website which to this day has been totally ignored. Finally, I received feedback on day 3 that my luggage has been found and is in Madrid. I immediately called the call centre number to find out when it will be delivered. The gentleman who answered told me that he does not control the shipping schedule but he expects it to be delivered this morning. It was not delivered in the morning, nor in the afternoon, nor in the evening. The next day, complete exasperated I took a taxi to the airport and picked up my luggage myself because I completely lost faith in any information I received from Swiss. I want to say that I am really disgusted by the level of service I received from Swiss Airlines. Luggage gets lost and I am not upset about this. But the miscommunication, lack of transparency and complete lack of empathy for my situation by Swiss Airlines is appalling.

"""attentive in-flight service""","New York to Budapest via Zurich. A glitch free pair of on-time flights with efficient and attentive in-flight service. The cabin layout in the Airbus 330 was open and airy in a 1-2-1 configuration. The window seat I had was not comfortable — it was hard. When I made it flat to sleep, it felt narrow. The blanket/duvet could have been larger. The pillow was overly small. My sleep was fitful. The TV screen was activated by touches but you had to stretch from your seat. No secure space to keep your passport, phone, wallet, glasses and the like. In summary, the hard product is inferior. On boarding, water, juice and champagne was offered followed by a hot towel. A menu booklet in several languages presented the dinner options which looked very complete and included fish, beef, chicken and a vegetarian choice. A selection of liquors was listed. There was a separate card listing choices for breakfast that needed to be be filled out - in effect, the flight attendants collected our orders. The breakfast was presented in a tidy manner. The order was correct - it was a continental breakfast. Hot towel provided before landing. The second flight of about 80 minutes to Budapest was excellent. A lunch of a cheese and ham salad with warm bread roll and full beverage service was provided. Before landing, the flight attendant passed a basket of Swiss chocolates. A sweet ending! All in all, the service was faultless but the seat and the seating environment in the Airbus 330-300 will discourage me from flying this aircraft on business class on Swiss.",1,7,R Sanyal,2019-07-06,yes,Business Class,Solo Leisure,New York to Budapest via Zurich,July 2019,2,4,4,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines

At that point I figured it was time to eat (?) - but lo and behold, a steward followed suit handing bread rolls to everyone and it was just dumped on top of my food container.

Check-in was quick and efficient, we departed and arrived punctually, and the plane was clean and neat. But Swiss uniquely uses a 1-2-2, 2-2-1 configuration. Seat Guru colors the first row of business class as green, but I don't see why. The so-called throne seats are certainly superior, but I didn't think they would be worth the premium that Swiss charges to select one. I was wrong. Yes, Swiss charges business class passengers to select seats. The paired seats at the windows are narrow, not particularly comfortable, and lacking in room to place your electronics without them falling on the floor or between the seats. Swiss also charges business class passengers to use WiFi. I would expect this on Spirit or Southwest, but not long haul on a 4 star airline. And then there was the meal. I chose the beef cheek, which came in a very tasty sauce, but two thirds of the meat was fat and gristle. In sum, this flight was a disappointment.

"""Never again SWISS""","Zurich to Manila via Hong Kong. SWISS sells connections that it does not intend to meet from the outset. Despite the short transfer time in Hong Kong, the SWISS waited for cargo rather than transporting their passengers on time! Mind you, the departure delay had nothing to do with weather or security or congestion at the airport; SWISS simply found it more appealing to earn a few extra franks by carrying any cargo than to get their passengers to their destination on time. Advertise with short transfer times, cash in there and then leave the passengers in the rain, which seems to be the business model of this rogue company. The transfer passengers were not rebooked on the next connecting flight but flew on until the early morning. The actually checked-through luggage we were allowed to check out and check in again (1 hour on the luggage belt waited!), And in between we had to wait hours on the transfer airport. A meager food coupon, which has just served for half a snack. In the end I arrived  one night later than planned. SWISS refuses to pay for the hotel bed, which I was unable to use because of additional business and the resulting night-long delay! No apology of any kind, and the complaint will be answered with customer's mockery! Never again SWISS! PS.

Mit kurzen Umsteigezeiten werben, dafür Geld kassieren und die Passagiere dann im Regen stehen lassen, das scheint das Geschäftsmodell dieser Gaunerfirma zu sein. Die Umsteigepassagiere wurden auch nicht auf den nächsten Anschlussflug umgebucht sondern flogen erst am frühen Morgen weiter.

IFE-screens were huge for economy standards and more responsive. Crew again friendly and professional crew, although I felt they should have responded quicker to an elder couple that was struggling to find free overhead space. Legroom was better on this flight. Meals were inferior to outbound leg, bland chicken and rice. Cleanliness again on a good standard. Again the friendly hello from the Captain was appreciated. Conclusion: Overall I have to compliment Swiss. I will choose Swiss flights operated on the Boeing 777-300ER whenever available (they use both on certain days from Zurich to Chicago) due to bigger legroom and superior screens. However, the A330 offers one advantage, the 2-4-2 setup against the 3-4-3 of the B777 in Economy.",1,8,B Martel,2018-10-22,yes,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,Zurich to Chicago,October 2018,4,3,4,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines

"""I did not enjoy my flight""",Highly disappointed with my Swiss business class flight from Bangkok to Zurich. Their business class seats are probably the worst I have experienced as some of the seats offer zero privacy and personal space. The Swiss business cabin is weirdly designed with basically three main types of seats: Window/Aisle pair seats which are simply horrible as: - the person seating near the window has no access to the aisle - the seats are very narrow - zero personal space - zero privacy The personal space aspect simply shocked me. There was just a middle console between the aisles and window seat and there was no space to set your bag or shoes or anything actually. This was shocking and I asked the flight attendants to help me understand if I was missing something and she apologized that some seats indeed have no real space and I should just use the overhead bins. The seats offered zero privacy and we also very narrow due to the outdated design although this was a relatively newly delivered aircraft. I would say that from a seat perspective it was terrible. The middle pair seats are better from a personal storage space although they are weird: one is very narrow from a space perspective and offers zero privacy yet a bit more storage space compare to the window/aisle pair and the other middle seat one offered much more space and privacy. Then there are the “throne” seats which come only one in a row which seem great but they cost an extra Euros. So overall from a seat perspective I found it horrible seating in the right side of the plane. Internet was the most expensive I have ever seen and sold by the MB (they count download AND upload) The least expensive option is 20MB for $ 10USD which they suggest is best “if you just intend to shortly check your emails or visit a couple of websites. 40 USD will get you a 120 MB package which on a flight of 11 hours is not enough to actively surf the net.

As I arrived at the guest which was half way boarded there was no separate line, neither a separate business class bus, but the ground staff allowed me to skip the line, which seemed to be a dedicated touch, but it was one my benefits. As I boarded the plane, once again there was not any type of difference between Business class or economy class passengers. The layout is the same of the economy class just with the middle seat blocked and some cm more for your legroom. As usual we were provided with some water and a refreshing towel. After all the hurry to catch my connecting flight we ended up staying on the ground half an hour more than expected, and here were the cabin staff should provide a little touch with is making more pleasant your flight, the ridiculous touch from swiss was offering to everyone a little chocolate praline, with no difference between economy or business class passengers. The service in the sky was really quick as the flight is a short one. The food was terrible, as they served three canapes, two salty, which did not have any type of flavor just intense color and smell and the same dessert in my previous flight, I asked for a coffee and the hostess brought a coffee which she before serving it to me said that It wasn´t a good quality therefore she would have changed for me if I wanted, and now my question is turning up asking me than why should you serve something which you already know that will be not matching the expectation of the guest? As I started to be tired I asked for a pillow which I brought out from the aircraft, once landed as I still had a long trip in front of me, and the maître of cabin apparently saw me and ran after me saying in a not so polite way that I was not allowed to take it out, but I mean it´s ok I can also understand this. As I upgraded to the business class I was entitled to have the priority tag for my suitcase, which is kind of an essential element if you have further connections, and the of course mine arrived after 15 min of the normal delivery of all other suitcases, this was a really big breakdown! In general, the SWISS service is not bad, and I cannot say I did not enjoy my upgrade, but sometimes it´s not required a big effort, it stays all in the little details.",0,5,Victor Sale,2018-07-20,yes,Business Class,Solo Leisure,Zurich to Venice,July 2018,3,2,1,2,2,Swiss International Air Lines

"""good airline in terms of comfort""","Their planes are very comfortable and have great airport staff/flight crews. However, Swiss is terrible at baggage handling and customer service.  The flight from FCO to ZRH was delayed about an hour & 10 minutes. Unfortunately, this meant we wouldn't catch our flight from ZRH to EWR as that flight was scheduled to depart five minutes before we arrived. My dad called Swiss who explained that they would provide us a voucher for a hotel near the Zurich airport and that they would make room on United 135 that would depart the next morning. Fast-forward to about fifteen minutes before we landed in Zurich, the flight attendants announce that our flight to EWR was delayed! In the jetbridge, we met a guy who thought there was a 40% chance that our bags would make it to our delayed connection. He then took us across the apron (where planes are parked) in an airport van to a secret security booth; he could not have been nicer, by the way. We made it to our flight and flew home to Newark, which was a pleasant flight. When we got to the luggage claim, none of our bags showed up because Swiss doesn't scan the barcodes on the bags. Luckily, the airport informed us that our bags would be on the flight the next day, that our bags would be delivered to our house, and that they would call us when the bags arrived. Under 36 hours later, we got a call at 05:17 (am) that our bags were waiting for us outside.

They made a whole service even departure was at midnight. None of the crew members was able to speak in an adequate level to the passenger nor even had eye contact. Just rude and unpolite.

Recently I flew 2 times with SWISS, from Miami to Rome via Zurich and from Miami to Moscow via Zurich. The business flight to and from Rome was pleasant and as expected. The issue is with the accreditation of miles, that still is not showing up in the Avianca LifeMiles account, even if all the data are correct and the boarding pass presented the correct number. With all the other alliance airlines the accreditation is very quick, and that is important because the accreditation may lead to the next level of membership so one may end up having flown miles and segments and not being recognized just because SWISS is not diligent with accrediting. The other situation was with a flight from Miami to Moscow that I had to cancel, and was told that all the ticket would be gone lost, beside the taxes. Of course that was part of the contract's small print but still this is unfair that a vendor takes and keeps the money for a service that was not rendered. Other star alliance airlines' experience with canceling reservations (no matter what category of ticket) was that one can use the amount paid for the ticket for rebooking other flights, paying a penalty and fare difference, of course! SWISS is an OK airline but quite frankly not up to standard with other Star Alliance airlines in fact of caring about frequent flyers and cancellation policies.

Then, again in its infinite wisdom, thought it best to kick a family of four (mine) with two kids under four off the flight.

Then they wouldn't let me take our fold up buggy, which fits in the overhead and they allowed on the flight to GVA, on the plane because they apparently changed policy mid week. Ridiculous experience. Kicking a young family off a plane because you over booked it is irresponsible. We flew at 8.50pm, well after their bedtime.

Plus it serves as Business Class lounge for other airlines as well. The food and drinks offering is extremely limited in this latter lounge. Last but not least, it is obvious that no investments have been made there for at least the last 10 years. Cabin crew on the flight to Zurich was extremely friendly and helpful however not very competent. Food was just ok but very limited (e.g. no snacks anymore etc.). The business class seats in the A330 are very dated. My seat was extremely uncomfortable as the air seat cushion did not properly work anymore. It felt as if I was sleeping on the floor. Last but not least, cabin temperature was far too high. Whenever I am flying Swiss, they heat up the cabin as no other airline does it. Not sure there is any guidance for the cabin crews in that respect but it is extremely uncomfortable for the passengers if one is trying to sleep.

"""terrible for short haul""","Bangkok to London via Zurich. I found a very cheap business class ticket with them. Before flying, I talked to their twitter account many times. The people who are responding are very fast, polite and informative people. I checked in online to be able to select a throne seat free of charge, and got a throne seat on the right hand Side of the plane. I arrived at the airport to be checked in very quickly by a polite trainee. I was told I could use any star alliance carrier lounge in Suvarnabhumi Airport, so I decided to use the Singapore airlines lounge. It was a newly renovated lounge with comfortable seating areas and heaps of food! One gesture I really appreciate Swiss for is the fact that they have a designated waiting area for First, Business and Gold card members at the boarding gate. Upon boarding, I'm greeted by a flight attendant who takes my coat, and champagne. I find the seat to be slightly narrow, especially at the foot portion, however I was able to sleep sideways. There is heaps of storage available everywhere. I would pay for this seat again if the price was a little less expensive (maybe $100 max). The flight attendants on this flight serving the business class section was mostly Thai crew, with the rest french-speaking Swiss crew. They were all engaging, polite and eager to help. The menu was presented with a choice of two starters and four main courses. I had a fish starter and a fish entree. The dessert tasted great, and there was a snack service during the flight, and another meal service before landing. I had a pasta with chicken and that was very good as well. The entertainment system was pretty poor, but was enough to keep me entertained. After landing in Zürich, I went to the Swiss lounge which had snacks and soup. I discovered I didn't get my Royal Orchid Plus number quoted in my boarding pass, and the lounge attendant was able to help me put in the number for my card. Boarding the A321 to London would've been chaotic without priority boarding, and the boarding process took long. The business class on short haul is horrible the empty middle seat made me feel like I was flying economy.  On this flight, there was a beef tartare served.

"""been the worst experience""","Dubai to Muscat.  I missed my connection in Dubai and was told in order to fly on the next available flight I would have to be downgraded to Business Class. Swiss not offer any compensation for this but  wanted to charge me a 220 AED change fee for the downgrade! Somehow after the missed connection in DXB my baggage ended up in an inaccessible part of the airport and I did not get access to it until just before the downgraded LX flight was due to depart the next day. I checked my bag in with Swiss  at DXB without any problem. The inflight service in Business Class from DXB to MCT was fine, however, when I arrived in MCT at around 04:30 AM my checked bag did not! I spent the next frustrating 1.5 hours trying to fill out a baggage claim request. This involved multiple people trying to fill out the online form and at least 3 or 4 attempts where I had to repeat all my information and details every time. I was assured by the LX baggage handlers that the bag would be placed on the “next available flight” and provided them with all my local contact details. Over the next day while in Muscat, I, and the hotel operator and concierge repeatedly called multiple Swiss  numbers both in Dubai and Muscat and could not get through to anyone. I called Swiss  main number in Switzerland, informing them of the situation and was given other phone numbers which kept ringing but no one answered at the other end. At one point, I was told the most senior Swiss representative in Muscat was being e-mailed to call me immediately at my hotel and I am still waiting for that phone call. I e-mailed Swiss customer support online and have yet to hear back from anyone. My abbreviated stay in Muscat came to an end and I boarded my next flights that took me to the Seychelles, again with no access to my checked bag, toiletries and wearing the same clothes that I had when I started my trip in Toronto 4 days earlier. After arriving in the Seychelles, I noticed on the Swiss online baggage tracker that my bag was due to be delivered from Dubai to MCT on a flight that evening. After multiple exasperating phone calls, including to Swiss headquarters in Europe, I was finally able to redirect my bag to the Seychelles, not on the first available flight but to one 8 hours later. When the bag finally arrived at SEZ, it was eventually delivered to my hotel, however, I was asked to pay for the taxi charge from the airport. To summarize, Swiss Airlines First Class treatment is deplorable. They are happy to downgrade their customers with no offer of a refund and then have the gall to ask for a change fee. They lose your luggage and make no effort to reach out to you afterwards in a timely fashion.

Although the aircraft was new (just over a year old) I went to the lavatory soon after boarding and saw the tap (see attached picture). This was rather shocking given the Swiss penchant for cleanliness. The grime built up on the tap appears to have not been addressed for weeks if not months. My other complaint concerns the WiFi product offered on Swiss which is a disgrace. The options come in MB packages and they are pitiful - my 120MB cost me CHF 39 and I could see the drain on my quota even when my iPhone was idle (I had turned off all background updates). Within minutes I exhausted my quota and I was doing basic operations such as checking email and sending text messages. I felt cheated out of 39 Swiss francs. Why doesn't Swiss offer the same plan as its parent Lufthansa, where you pay a flat fee and get wifi for the entire duration of the flight?

Specially because plane was leaving from satellite terminal what means a short drive by airport train.

Plane was an A320. Nothing special, shared IFE, but I had my laptop with me. Food service was well organized, food was quite innovative (quiche loraine), but being served in paper boxes ruined the general impression. After the meal there was a second drink service, so generally everything on acceptable level. In Moscow luggage service was smooth. Back to GVA on a brand new CSeries. Terrible airplane. Hard seats, IFE screens so small that were useless, some smart designer guy divided the net on the back of the sits in two parts, so you can not even put a book into it, forget about laptop or tablet.

One thing which was a bit of an usual thing for me, was during the rest hours the lights in the cabin was actually pretty bright for my standard (compared say to AY, SQ and GA). Food was amazing, the airline brought local tastes every month, and the variety was also very good. There were about 3 courses for dinner, and that did not include the chocolates at the end. Cabin crews were friendly, however just to note, in my opinion it would also good to be recognized.

"""did not get a bassinet row""","I travelled from Zurich to Singapore on 23 Oct with my son of 22 months old.

The telephone service had reassured me on 20 Oct that my row 40 was already reserved. When i checked in, i did not get a bassinet row nor a bassinet for my child, because i was told that the limit of bassinet was 8 months.  With the infant on my lap in a middle row of economy class, i could not eat as the table was not possible to be let down flat. The person before me could not lean her seat because it collided with my child's head.  Upon arrival in Singapore, i called Swiss Air to figure out how to get a child seat for my infant. I was told that i could not upgrade the ticket, and had to purchase a one way ticket for a child. I should also not give the real birthdate of the baby but enter a wrong year so that the child ticket could go through. It costed me EUR 630. I find this very strange practice to enter the wrong date of birth. It makes no sense to buy an infant ticket with Swiss Airlines for a child between 9 months and 2 years old. And since this is not anywhere well documented during the ticket purchase process, there will be mistaken parents. The stewardesses were sympathetic but not very helpful in my situation.

The seat was very narrow and when in the lie flat setting my feet hardly fit making for a very uncomfortable sleep (but I did have lots of useless storage space!). I think before an airline installs such seats the corporate executives need to sleep in them for a few nights. Service was very limited, as the flight seemed understaffed. I received my pre-flight drink, but nothing more was offered until dinner. There was no pre-dinner bar service or appetizer. Dinner, although the food was good it was bear bones, an basic entre, small salad and bread. Although I was served one glass of wine, it took a few tries to get a refill (one only). A small slice of cake was the sole dessert (they did come by and offered one small Swiss chocolate). Breakfast was basic, yogurt and bread. Overall the business class section is cramped with, in my opinion, narrow uncomfortable seats. Meal service was very basic.

"""service by the book without a smile""","I fly several times a year with Swiss and they are fairly consistent: great aircraft, on time, unfriendly crew. I always make a point with this airline to greet each crew member, and see how many respond - nearly 100% this time but sometimes I was the one who initiated. Most convenient boarding gate in Geneva, short 30 minute hop to Zurich where they gave us a bottle of water and the signature chocolate just to remind you that you're not on easyJet (which is an effective marketing strategy). Smooth short transfer and boarding for another short 45 minute hop to Venice. Pretty bumpy for the whole flight which went straight over the Alps in stormy weather. Crew still managed to work quickly and serve everyone a drink - tea, coffee, wine, beer, soft drinks - which was impressive. No reassurance from the pilot about the turbulence though, and the cabin attendant only spoke German and English. When your selling point is that you're the national airline and you connect Geneva-based passengers through Zurich, it's inexcusable that you can't perform trolley service in French - all Swiss train conductors speak four languages and the competition - easyJet Switzerland - flies to Venice directly with French-speaking crew. (Ideally Italian would be offered as it's also a national language and this flight was to Italy - the pilot on the way back did make an Italian announcement but he was the only one. LH subsidiary Air Dolimiti attendants all speak EN DE FR IT, so this is possible). Delay in Venice waiting for steps - but this was well communicated. On the way back, we flew on their fancy new CS100 aircraft with Ferrari-esque interiors. That's all well and good but you need to turn on the air conditioning before passengers board (a regular issue with Swiss). A cabin attendant just stood next to my co-passenger and watched her struggle to put her bag in the overhead locker even after she was asked (in Swiss German) if she thought the duty free bag could go up there. (She responded with a ""yes"" and a look that said ""of course you can put your luggage in a the luggage bin"".) The CS100 has massive luggage bins which is great, but quite a few people hit their heads on them when disembarking - a little warning from the crew would be nice.

It was a joy to watch. The crew were outstandingly polyglot. Apart from the standard fluency in English, German and French you would expect from a Swiss crew, some crew members even had some competency in Spanish and Portuguese. The aircraft was very clean. There wasn't too much leg room, but it was sufficient. Though it was only a 55-minute flight, there were drinks and sandwiches served. The sandwiches were really tasty.

I took an eleven hour flight from Hong Kong to Zurich on August third, and as soon as the plane was in the air it was obvious something was wrong and we had to emergency land in Moscow for six hours.

We ended up on the flight for 21 hours, I missed my connecting flight, was put on a plane backw to Frankfurt and then a flight to Dublin four hours later. I should have been home by 4pm latest, I was home at 4am that night. On top of that, all they did to say sorry was give us a food voucher only usable in four variations of basically the same sandwich shop who wouldn't make you a new sandwich if you didn't like the ones on display. I will say the cabin crew were very friendly and seemed to be following protocol, and they made it easier to stick. The seats in economy were cramped and uncomfortable. The food was standard, they didn't sell snacks. The movie selection was alright, but you had to pay for wifi which annoys me.The flight to Hong Kong was fine, I had no qualms with it.

A number of TV screens were located throughout the cabin which showed the progress of the flight, which is not something you see very often on European flights. The food offered (morning flight) was a choice of a ""sweet or salty"" quiche. I think savoury was the word they were looking for! Anyway, I had the sweet quiche which was very nice. The savoury quiche got the thumbs up as well. Drinks were also offered. The Swiss chocolate later in the flight was a nice touch. All the cabin crew were very friendly and polite.

When it comes to meal times, the cabin crew doesn't help to ask the passenger in front of you to move the seat upright so that you are able to have eating space - as a result the poor passenger who is seated behind a reclined seat may choose to suffer in silence (from my observation as I had a thoughtful passenger in front of me). The seats were uncomfortable, lacking in thigh and lower back support. The pillow wasn't enough to support the lower back. I had to get out of my seats quite often to stretch.

"""attendants friendly, very helpful and efficient""","Dubai to Brussels via Zurich. I bought an upgrade from Business class to First class on the Dubai to Zurich sector through Swiss' new ""bidding"" option. I will not get into the terrible pre-boarding experience (no priority lane at security, no first class lounge, full senator lounge) and go straight to the onboard experience. I sat in seat 2D. Even before take-off I noticed that the headphone was not working properly (sound in only 1 ear). With only 8 seats in first class it is asking too much to check these before flights? I was given a new headphone after take-off. Quality wise these headphones are low quality: no noise cancelling. I can say only positive things about the flight attendants who were friendly, very helpful and efficient. Meal service was somewhat disappointing: for main course it was either chicken or pasta. The quality was fine but not exceptional. I would have expected a bigger choice. Different from business class? Not really except for better quality wine and better presentation. Sleep quality: you get a set of pyjamas and the flight attendant puts a small mattress and duvet. So I slept very well. Flight entertainment: same offerings as in Business with movies the same for an entire month. So don't travel SWISS too much or you will be watching the same movies. Was it worth the extra cost between business and First? Not really. But what always ruins the experience when you fly to Brussels via Zurich: on the leg between Zurich and Brussels they use the tiniest plane they have and you are put on a bus between the terminal and the plane. Rain or snow does not seem to matter. Get on the bus. So this is far from being a first class experience.

I had purchased a fare including one bag to check-in, but was not sure whether to check-in my carry-on. I asked at check-in, and together with the agent we agreed that I could carry my bag on-board. When boarding, a SWISS Gate agent tells me that there is no way that I can bring this bag on board, since the plane is absolutely full. Given that the agent was not very keen on listening to customer input to put it mildly, I accepted to have the bag tagged. When boarding was completed, the plane was not even half full, and the space above my seat was completely empty. Three carry-ons of approved size such as mine could easily have fit into the overhead space. However, today was not one those days at SWISS. I really encourage adhering to rules, but it is a two-way street, and today's performance by SWISS is enough for me to consider another carrier next time. In addition, the service level overall on-board today's flight was not impressive. The staff seemed to have misunderstood the fact that they are there to work and assist passengers.

My friend and I reached Paris airport way before and started queuing at 1800 even before the check-in counter for Swiss was opened. We were 2nd in line, and upon reaching the counter, were told the flight was overbooked when the service staff knew we were flying to Singapore. He offered a solution to fly us with Air France given we were involuntarily bumped from the flight without much alternatives, and were told to come back in an hour's time when the check-in counter would be closing. I had chosen to fly with Swiss because I have heard reviews on great service and flight quality but if you are offering to fly me with another carrier, I would have just chosen to fly with Air France in the first place without going through so much headache at the check-in counter. So we heeded the guy's suggestion to come back in another hour and we were on 'standby' list. But what I don't appreciate is the attitude the service staff who wasn't even apologetic that we were in this situation at all. He was the duty manager at the period of time but he was not providing the best solution to our benefit. He even told us to write a complaint to Swiss. I was appalled and amused by his reasoning. A flight that is overbooked is not a passenger's fault, and I think we have the right to reclaim our seats, plus I had the screenshot to confirm I was checked in with seats allocated.

People were arguing throughout the flight, because people's knees were already scraping the seat in front, so if anyone moved, they caused discomfort to someone else.  The worst 4 hour flight I have had. They show you a safety video before you take off and it is unrealistic to believe that anyone in economy could have done half of what was mentioned in the video. The man in the photo was probably about 5 ft 5 (165 cms) and  he had no leg room whatsoever. If you are going to cram people into a plane to such an extent that they can't move, then the seats should not be adjustable.

"""not use SWISS again in a hurry""","Malta to Brussels via Zurich. My problems began with SWISS following my reservation, I contacted them to try to reserve seats as they had actually suceeded reserving seats in two different rows for myself and my travel companion. I contacted them by email after a number of emails finally got reserved seats. The level of customer service given was nil. When checking in for the first leg of my flight from Malta to Zurich I was shocked to see that my seats has been moved for the second leg and again they had given me seats in two different rows when I had clearly told them about this before. The flight left Malta late due to a problem with a cargo door, this was finally sorted. I was a little worried as I only had 25 mins between flights in the first place. My travelling companion asked to purser if we would still make the connection were were assured yes as there was little distance between gates. We would get further information on the overhead screens on the flight. When this information came up to my shocked is showed that we were rebooked on the next leg of the flight. We I asked the purser why she was very offish and said she could do nothing and had no information to such a point as being rude. Shortly before landing the display screen changed to show that we needed to go immediately to the gate for our connecting flight. How can SWISS actually make so many mistakes in one instance.

Every seat had a blanket, pillow, TV, USB point, headphones available - something you would long to see in any US carrier.

Swiss needs to know that not every passenger on their flights speak German or French. We departed on time and service commenced quickly and very efficiently. I admire the Swiss efficiency. Drinks were offered with salty biscuits and then lunch as a choice of 1 vegetarian option of noodle or a non-veg of chicken with aubergines. Serve with salad, dessert and Swiss cheese as well as additional large cans of soft drinks made this a very good meal for economy. The IFE needs to improve.

The first leg from Sydney-Bangkok was Thai (a bassinet was provided on this flight). We had a long transit (18 hours) and Swiss do not arrange transit accommodation in Bangkok or lounge access, their office opens three hours before the flight and you need a boarding pass to enter the lounge, so you are 'on your own' with no baggage, no lounge access and need to arrange your own hotel and visa. (my wife needed to pay for visa on arrival) - this was very inconvenient and traumatic for us at the last minute with a small baby and the Thai staff (there were no Swiss staff) said 'talk to Swiss tomorrow'. On both Swiss legs the airline failed to give a bassinet for our two month old baby so we had to nurse him for 14 hours of flights in total. The crew of the first flight tried their best to help and messaged Zurich to ensure the second flight would have a bassinet but there was still no bassinet for that flight. Our baby's ticket was almost USD$1000 so we expected something for the money spent. Very disappointing, though the crew tried, clearly the systems don't work - based on advice from the crew they have a new system or someone possibly unilaterally decided it was not required. To add insult to injury we were unable to get our choice of meal on the longer flights and were advised that priority meals was given to frequent flyers and that even though we had been through an awful experience 'its our policy' We have contacted contacted customer service but received no response for three weeks and counting.

I complied with the request, asking only to remove a few items I deemed too important to be checked-in. The ladies handling my check-in were however rather rude.

Baffled, I asked the lady processing the transaction on my card how did they determine which passengers to stop and check. She, however, chose to ignore me. So I posed the question to the gentlemen who first asked me to step aside. He quickly replied, volume and weight. But when I pointed out that my baggage was in fact, never weighed, he looked shocked and deferred to his colleague who had earlier ignored me. I did not press the matter further then, as I knew I would not be able to get a straight answer from them. Instead, I emailed the airlines directly to clarify this matter about a week later. I raised the same question to them, and in addition, asked if it was right for the ground crew to charge me overweight fees without weighing my bag.

"""Swiss is not supposed to be low-cost""","We were flying in a group of 14 people with 5 kids from Barcelona to Moscow with a stopover in Zurich (round trip) on June 2016. Our trip was totally terrible that I would not recommend to anyone, especially if you travel with kids. Here is the list of problems we found during our trip: 1) All planes we took departed with a 30-40 mins delay. Having a 40-mins stopover in Zurich meant we had to run with kids in Zurich airport in order not to miss the next flight. They try to make as many deals as possible, offering impossible-to-complete stopovers. Don't buy tickets from them if the stopover is less than 1 hour. You have high chances of missing your next flight. 2) Baggage lost. We had 2 pushchairs for kids that were lost both on our way to Moscow and on our way back to Barcelona. We stayed in Moscow for 3 days, the lost pushchairs were delivered to our hotel on the night of our 3rd day. So, it was worth nothing taking pushchairs at all. Moreover, one of our luggages was lost on our way back. 3) SWISS office in Moscow Domodedovo airport has a awful customer service. These are my main complaints, but there were some other issues during the flight: food was poor, we had problems ordering special gluten-free food in advance. Stewards misinformed us by saying that the 40-mins delayed departure of the plane will be compensated during the flight and we will arrive on time (that in our case was not true). In Zurich airport there is no special lines for customers who are about to miss their flight, they go at a slow rhythm and just don't care if you miss the flight. I am often travelling with european low-cost airlines and I know that you have to sacrifice some comfort if you decide to pay less. Swiss is not supposed to be low-cost, but its service is just so bad that would rather I prefer Vueling or Ryanair with whom I have never had any problem like that.",0,1,Elizaveta Erokhina,2016-06-27,no,Economy Class,Family Leisure,BCN to DME via ZRH,June 2016,3,1,1,1,1,Swiss International Air Lines
"""seats are very comfortable""","I fly approximately 100 flights per year and chose Swiss for 95%. This time I had to fly another airline coming back from San Francisco and realized the huge difference in service, food and crew attitude. The flight from Zurich to Chicago is about 9.10h, from the lounge we were driven to the E terminal and boarded promptly. Once on board the multilingual crew offered us a glass of champagne, presented the amenity kit and pyjamas and came with an 'amuse bouche' a tasty small appetizer. After take off, we were offered an aperitif. Following that the table was set up and lunch was served. Balik, cold cuts, scallops followed by soup and or salad, choice of four main courses, cheese, fruit and desert. Food taste and presentation is like eating in a good restaurant. Seats are very comfortable and turns into a real bed with a good size pillow and duvet. Before landing a choice of hot and cold foods is served. Upon arrival, first class passengers are met and escorted to the luggage claim.

"""antagonising most loyal customers""","Swiss has recently taken over the route I fly most, Geneva to Munich, from Lufthansa. I always purchase a Z class business GVA-MUC and a D class business ticket for the return flight. I do so because I want to be able to catch an earlier flight home if my meeting finishes early and I always book on the last flight in case it doesn't. Until the summer timetable when Swiss took over, LH allowed me during the on-line check-in to ask for a reservation change. If the reservation change could not be approved immediately I was put on the waitlist and I always (99% of the time) succeeded in getting a seat. Swiss has a new policy. They sell you a D class (which is quite expensive) and when you try to change (you can no longer do this online) they demand a payment of an extra €200 (for a ticket that already costs over €1000). When I ask why, I am told the D class if full. I then get on board and find that out of 20 business class seats, only 3 are occupied. I asked the other passengers on my flight last week what booking class they had, and none of them were in D. I wrote to complain and sent in pictures of the empty business class section. I got a boilerplate answer which did not address any of the points I made. Can a carrier be held to account for dishonest advertising. Why do they sell a class which they claim is changeable but in practise it isn't. Swissair and its successor Swiss used to be such a great airline. They are doing remarkably well in antagonising their most loyal customers. It is a shame when a premium airline offers less service than say Easyjet which always allows you to travel on an earlier flight than the one you booked if there is space.  On my route I don't have a choice. But I am longing for the day that Easyjet decides to operate the route.",0,4,Peter Sand,2016-06-16,no,Business Class,Business,MUC to GVA,June 2016,4,2,1,4,1,Swiss International Air Lines

"""cost cutting effect clearly seen""","Moscow to Montreal via Zurich with Swiss. Check-in at Domodedovo airport a breeze. The lounge next to the gate is very tired looking. Priority boarding respected. Flight to Zürich was ok, breakfast poor. No fresh fruits, but champagne free flowing. Middle seat is kept free, but the new leather covered seats are very thin, and have a minimalistic recline. Lounge at Zürich in terminal D is an oasis. Boarding to Montreal was a hassle. I was very disappointed with the brand new B777. Business class has 62 seats (too many), losing the special charm. Cabin layout feels cramped unless having a single seat. Colors are darkish, and my elbow pressed accidentally many times the seat control buttons. Drink served before take-off, and thanks that the cabin was max 1/3 full, service was friendly, and refills automatic. Lunch (I had a pretty good steak, presentation poor) served on a plastic tray, didn`t enhance the feeling. Few excellent wines, Swiss white, and Italian red. Entertainment selection very limited if compared to Emirates. The screen was nice size, fully touchscreen. After landing in Montreal, it took 15 minutes for the crew to open the door, even the captain had to come and help. Personnel at the check-in for the return flight were unfriendly, and rude. Air Canada Maple Leaf lounge very nice, modern and lot`s of light. Great view to the tarmac area. Boarding was announced in the lounge, but business passengers had to still wait a good bit at the gate due to poor coordination. Cabin full, and the person serving me not happy. Dinner, fish, was nothing special, more of an economy plus quality. I had to request for refills. Three toilets for the business class were kept clean during the 7 hour flight. Seat made to a flat bed. Arrival roughly on time. Very poor directions for the Swiss arrivals lounge at Zürich. Lounge and shower facilities very nice. Full flight back to Moscow. Lunch was very poor, whole-grain Raviolis in tomato sauce; Disgusting looking, pasta glued to each other. Arrival on-time, and luggage delivery surprisingly quickly.

The inflight meal and entertainment were good with a lot of food and beverage choices from ZRH to BKK. Before reaching BKK airport, the crew gave passengers a swiss chocolate. The cabin was clean and the seat had room and was comfortable. The economy ticket price was acceptable for the route from Europe to BKK. One thing that was unacceptable was related to the ground staf. The check-in staff did not seem know the Swiss Air Lines product and swiss frequent traveller status right.

"""were delayed 7 hours""","From London to Geneva, we were delayed 7 hours and stuck on the plane with 1 cup of water and a sandwich for the duration while we waited. The staff were rude and no apologies were forthcoming. We had a small family (2 toddlers) and no empathy was shown for our situation, keeping them entertained and in their seats for 7 hours is not easy. We were then diverted to Zurich, where we were met with even less help and more staff rudeness. The manner in which the whole situation was handled was appalling. We ended up paying for our own hotel and transfers with not a care shown from Swiss staff. Our return trip was worse, our flight from Geneva to London was cancelled late in the piece, they then lost our luggage and again showed no compassion or care. Their staff are unhelpful, the worst we have ever encountered.

Swiss was more expensive than other airlines connecting through FRA, CDG, LHR etc. I prefer to travel on A330 as I can choose the 2 seats at the window, which give me and my Partner a maximum of comfort. With an hour delay into ZRH due to bad weather, we were still able to catch our connection as ZRH airport is a smooth connecting airport with rather short ways. The flight was uneventful, good product standards, however the crew wasn't very friendly on the longhaul and lacked interest in the passengers. The return flight was a lot better crew-wise and the steward on our side was friendly and approachable. I didn't like the fact that Lufthansa and Swiss use the same check-in for economy passengers, LH had 2 flights leaving (A380 and A330) plus the Swiss A330 comes close to 800 people in the queue. On top, we only wanted to drop our bags.

"""good Business Class product""","Solid Business Class Product. Vienna to London City via Zurich in October 2015, both legs in Business on an A320 and Avro 100 (operated by Swiss Global) respectively. VIE-ZRH delayed 15 minutes, no problem. ZRH-LCY on time. Transfer in ZRH fast and easy without extra security checks for intra EU-transfers. ZRH is a pleasant airport for transfers. LX uses Economy seats with the middle seat unsold for Business Class, which are after all nothing else but not too comfortable Economy seats. However the seat pitch is better than in Economy. Not great, but sort of okay due to short duration of the flights. Inflight service on both legs was friendly and very attentive. A bottle of water is served as you board. Food was a cold meat salad snack; ok, but not really that good. On this particular flight, probably the weak point of the service. Full bar service and good (Swiss) wines. Check-in in VIE (handled by OS) was fast and very friendly. Boarding in VIE slightly messy as no room to queue or for separate lines due to terrible design of the Skylink terminal. Boarding in ZRH uneventful. Swiss used Austrian Airlines lounges in VIE. Senator Schengen lounge just average and not great for being Austrian’s flagship lounge - very limited snacks and average drink selection. Did not use a lounge in ZRH due to short connection time. Arrival process in LCY great, border control efficient with short lines, luggage fast, priority luggage first. Swiss offers a good Business Class product, except for the fact that they use Economy seats in Business as most European airlines.

LCY has outgrown itself and is like some crowded street bazaar with space at a premium. The boarding gate had a separate area for First, Business, Senator, Star Gold so we stood in that pen. Onboard service was impeccable, water and cold packaged towels offered followed by, after take off, drinks, we had champagne and a tasty crab salad, a creamy dessert and cheese served by a very personable chef de cabine. Easy to get to the Senator lounge at Zurich and it was almost empty but it closes at 21.00 so we had to go to the crowded second rate Panorama lounge - not good. Quick boarding on our flight to Hong Kong and welcomed with drinks, hot towels and menus. The seats are comfortable but a little tight on space when fully reclined, especially compared with the Business class seat on the Lufthansa 380. We chose row 9 middle. Very good dinner service, starter, nice choice of mains, cheese and dessert with drinks including Swiss wines, enhanced by exquisite service from cabin crew. We managed to sleep for several hours before a very tasty breakfast consisting of a choice from the trolley with both hot and cold options or both. Two excellent flights with excellent crew.

Next day flight again cancelled, staff could not have been more helpful and eventually got on a flight to London Heathrow.

The cabin was very hot. There's no nice undersheet to go over the seat when you go to sleep. Business Cabin is quite crowded - the only good aspect was, everyone behaved and was quiet.

"""very charming and attentive cabin crew""","After reading some of the reviews of Swiss I was a little apprehensive when booking the long haul Bangkok to Zurich flight. The flight started well at check-in when we were invited to the new EVA Air lounge in Bangkok which must be one of the best Business class lounges anywhere. Uncrowded, well laid out, comfortable with a wide selection of appetising food. The Swiss A340 flown wasn't showing its age and the cabin lay-out, while 'different', was fully acceptable; lie-flat seats comfortable though rather 'firm'. Much has been made of the small IFE screens but the picture is very clear and presented no viewing problems. Lunch was served soon after take-off and no lover of good-quality food could have cause for criticism of what was served; an appealing selection of dishes well presented. Certainly as good as any meal I've had in recent times in Business class. The wine selection of course contained a Swiss white and a red, the sylvaner not to my taste but the pinot noir quite acceptable. But the inclusion of a first class Bordeaux (a 2011 St Emillion) had me asking for a refill (or two!). Before landing at Zurich a light meal was offered, just enough to see you through the rest of the day with a 19.30 arrival. Swiss cabin staff have been criticised by some as being somewhat impersonal but we found the opposite being attended by two very charming and attentive cabin crew. Nice to be addressed by name, something which is rare these days other than in First class.

If you are a Star Alliance status member, you are assigned a ground hostess to guide you through security and immigration to the lounge, which at this time of the day (11:00 a.m.) is empty. Half an hour prior departure, you are escorted to the gate and to the aircraft. It turned out that I was the only Swiss in the very front of the cabin, and the welcome by cabin staff was warm. I got an appetizer, champagne, newspaper and pyjamas after boarding. Departure was on time, and towards cruising altitude, lunch was served. Nice choice of starters, and my favourite Swiss dish (which was not on the menu), was also available. With a glass of La Chapelle de la Mission-Haut Brion and cheese at the end, the lunch was perfect. I tried to have a nap, which is difficult early afternoon.  A very charming flight attendant, as this part of the cabin was only half full, she had time for some conversation. About an hour prior landing, small diner options were offered. When disembarking the aircraft in Zurich, First class are treated the same as Economy. There is no escort, you use the train to the main terminal and you queue up at immigration.

We then couldn't re-fuel and were told we may not be able to make curfew for Zurich which would have meant the holiday was over.

What made these flight stand out from the connecting flights on SQ was the crew. Whereas SQ's delivered a perfect product, LX's crew may not have been quite so efficient - but they added a personal touch even in the economy cabin. I felt like a guest, someone to be welcomed on board, a person in the same right as the crew. I was not the customer to be satisfied. I was a person to interact with. Yes, the grooming of SQ's FAs was spotless. But LX's FAs were certainly a lot more likeable.

Seat recline was also decent and the seats themselves were very comfortable when I was seated properly. One downside was that there were no power outlets on any of the seats, only a USB port which was not working.

The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful and spoke in various other languages aside from English, German and French. The flight was smooth, relaxing and quiet. Swiss International Airlines has also done a wonderful job in their product branding and the attention to detail was exquisite, with things such as full metal cutlery and the complementary Swiss chocolate that's given out before arrival.

Very devious as they assume that passengers may not make it not thinking that some are ambitious enough to run and sell the seats off to passengers from other airlines on standby. Denied boarding? but funny the seats were taken by other passengers - does not take a kindergarten kid to figure out what happened to the seats. Explanation, we cannot take you without your bags for security reasons. Who delayed the bags - not the passenger. Well when they do not load the bag, does not the bag go on another flight without the passenger? Best is a complaint written to Swiss customer service and they respond back saying ""We are not responsible for the delay."" Did they honestly think people were ignorant.",0,1,Rosemarie Armstrong,2015-08-18,no,Economy Class,Family Leisure,Dubai to Amsterdam via Zurich,July 2015,1,1,1,1,1,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"Overall good experience for European Economy - VIE-ZRH-CPH on July 6, both legs in Economy on an Airbus 321 and Airbus 320, respectively. VIE-ZRH delayed in 10 minutes increments at departure resulting finally in 50 minutes arrival delay in ZRH. ZRH-CPH on time. ZRH is a fast and easy airport without extra security checks for intra EU-transfers, so tight connection not a problem despite late arrival. Only travelling with hand luggage, so not sure if checked luggage would have made it as well. LX uses Recaro slim line seats, which are not the most comfortable option, but ok for the short flights and legroom was fine. Both planes were packed. In flight service on both legs was good for Economy. FA’s on the VIE-ZRH leg professional and courteous, but not really attentive; much better and friendlier crew on the ZRH-CPH leg. Food served was a croissant (good) on the first leg and a sandwich (just edible) on the second leg. One round of drinks per leg including beer and wine. Web check-in (through LH site) worked fine. LX used OS lounges in VIE. Senator Schengen lounge just very average and not great for being OS’s flagship lounge. Scrambled eggs and turkey ham plus pastries for breakfast and average drink selection. Ticket was rather expensive due to late booking but not more so than other options available at that time.",0,9,R Simon,2015-08-17,yes,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,VIE to CPH via ZRH,July 2015,4,4,4,5,3,Swiss International Air Lines

Service was good with FA's very attentive and polite, don't expect too much in Economy with regards to food, it was just a spinach quiche (warmed up) although very tasty.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"Business Class at Swiss have nothing in common with Business Classes of competitors. Swiss is very expensive, but the promised Service on their Website has not been delivered at all. Not before, not during and not after the flight. Some examples of the bad experience: On one way the meal was the same as Economy, the Hostess started to serve in the back and ended up with Business Class. The Business Class Check-In staff member was busy (over 15 minutes) with a Client, so that we had to line-up on the Economy side.

The inflight system was somewhat above average, as it had most recent movies, and also the games were of decent quality, however the cabin crew service exceeded my expectation (one never expects to get an ice cream in an economy class).

The flight was delayed but only for 20 minutes. Once onboard, the crew were friendly, seat pitch good (due to the new economy seats - good for short haul) and the plane was clean. Food on offer was minimum but it was a hot dish which was better than the sandwich offerred on Lufthansa. Transfer in Zurich was smooth as usual. Zurich to London City flight was operated by Helvetic. A bit disappointing as the plane looked old and the crew were not as groomed as the Swiss flight.

Positives : Ground staff at all stations were very helpful and all flights were on time. Seats are fully flat and crew on the return flights were reasonably helpful. Negatives : Food outbound was awful and crew on the LAX-ZRH and ZRH-TLV legs behaved like they didnt want to be there. No smiles and no one went above and beyond. Seat is fully flat but looks tired and worn out. Got the ""throne seat"" for 2 of the legs which is very nice but entertainment like Lufthansa is outdated.

But we got the full fire brigade water jet arrival in Malta despite being a little late, together with a nice welcome ceremony by Malta airport in the terminal with flowers and cake for every passenger and the crew. Business class service enroute was very professional and pleasant too, with a substantial hot lunch with meat loaf as a main course as a surprise option on this 1155 departure. A cold dish was also offered. The meal came with salad, dessert and cheeses too. The only let down was a mediocre and inexpensive supermarket brand as the only white wine on offer.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"Return trip during the first week of Swiss service into Malta. Despite an hours delay the flight was pleasant and the fact that it was not that full probably helped. The service on this mid afternoon flight was as efficient as ever and the cabin crew were friendly too. It was a pleasant surprise to receive a hot cheese quiche to eat instead of the more usual cold cheese or ham roll. Of note the complimentary white wine was better than the wine that we had in business on the way down and it was cold. Coming down none of the cold drinks in business had been cooled down, so we had wine with ice cubes. Today there was nobody sat in the four rows of business class so it was curious to see the crew still pull the curtains across. Perhaps to keep the forward bathroom off limits.

The aircraft had overhead screens but they were only really used for the safety video (which curiously they only do in English and then ask passengers who speak one of their three main languages to ask the crew if they have questions). Strange croissant with a pretzel coating (but in my past experience Swiss food is not nice, even in business) and wide selection of drinks including alcohol. I had flown out on Austrian and the quality of Swiss is just a couple of notches higher. I did check in online but the Swiss website sends you to Lufthansa for some reason.

Flight was late out of LIS, just 20 minutes for the transfer to MUC, but baggage made it. Crews generally friendly, cold snack (nothing worth to write about it) served on the longer routes.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"European flights are a breeze and flying through Zurich airport is almost a must! On my flight to Sao Paulo the A340 is still in good condition, staff helpful and polite and the food very tasteful. The seats still have the Swiss dark brown and light panel wood and  having single seats is very appealing. The only downside is the flight entertainment system. It is starting to show its age. Compared with some other airlines the Swiss Business Class screen of 12 inch doesn't compare to what is on the market. If you choose to watch films with a dark background most of the detail in the film escapes the eye. It is almost difficult to watch and for long flights a good screen is important. I hope that with the new Boeing 777's coming in 2016 they will decide on a new system for video/audio. If the entertainment system would have been top notch then I would have given the 10/10 but seeing as this a real bother I decided not to give full marks.",0,8,James Qurashi,2015-06-26,yes,Business Class,Business,GVA-ZRH-GRU,May 2015,4,5,5,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines

The A343 seems in good shape when you enter the cabin, really nice the light coloured wood with dark brown seats, very smart. I measure 176 cm so the seats in full flat position were quite good, no worries there, the food was enough and good. The only down side was the inflight entertainment system. They have an ok selection in films but the screen size and resolution is not up to business class standards, some airlines have a better system even in Economy. I do hope that they improve with the new B777 entering next year. The 12 inch is not nearly good enough and the resolution is passable.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,MAN-HKG-MAN. Flights went via Zurich and booked exit rows on 3 out of the legs. For some reason I could not book exit row on the Hong Kong to Zurich leg which turned to be the worst of the 4 as passenger next to me had no concept of personal space. Tried to drop hints every time he nudged kicked or used my shoulder as a surrogate pillow but he spoke no English so I just gave up. Despite that I thought nearly all aspects of the product were excellent apart from the inflight entertainment system on the A340 between Zurich and Hong Kong. Decent choice of music and films but the system itself kept stalling when making menu selections (not when actually watching a movie).

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,I flew to Zurich from Montreal last week. The food that I had was great (chicken and rice outbound chicken meatloaf on the return flight). Flight attendants were great as well. The only problem was the entertainment system. On the flight to Zurich everyone's systems worked except for my row and a few around. They tried individually resetting them but no success. After three and a half hours and a reboot of the entire flight's system it worked. On the way back to Montreal the entertainment worked for only about one hour and a half then three reboots had to be done (each lasting 30+ mins) before they worked again. Flight attendants worked hard in trying to get them to work and did apologize for all of the inconveniences. Movie TV shows and game selection was good.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,ZRH-YUL on A330-300. I was upgraded to Business at the time of boarding which was most welcome as I had had an arduous day of travel and this was my last leg heading home. Upon arrival at the door of the aircraft we were told to standby as the cabin was not ready which meant a congregation of passengers in the jet-way. I found this to be highly atypical for an airline I usually associate with precision. On board the seat was spacious comfortable and offered power ports for USB and 110VAC. The amenity kit was pretty basic but I liked the packaging which was designed to serve as a tablet/iPad case after landing. IFE had a good selection of movies with respectable size screens and good audio. FA's were efficient and friendly and came around often. Food presentation was good but taste not so. There was plenty to choose from for drinks albeit the wine selection was limited. Ice cream was served twice during the flight which made up for subpar food quality. Flight left late but arrived ahead of schedule due to strong tail winds and we were kept abreast of the flight's progress by the captain throughout the journey. Overall Swiss offers a good consistent product and makes you feel welcome on board. With a slight improvement in Business Class catering I would easily rate them as my favourite European carrier.,0,8,T Eldem,2015-03-25,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,5,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,AMS-ZRH-GRU on Jan 3 AMS-ZRH on an Airbus 320 ZRH-GRU on an Airbus 340-300 both legs in Business Class AMS-ZRH was on time FA's were friendly and attentive a simple continental breakfast was served nothing special but fine for the short hop. As with most flights in Europe seats were economy seats with the middle seat left unsold LX uses the Recaro slim seats which are rather uncomfortable but again ok for this short flight and leg room was ok. ZRH-GRU (day flight) was on-time and an excellent experience on all levels modern and clean plane (as one comes to expect from LX) with a 1-2-1/2-2-1 configuration with lie flat seats. IFE was AVOD movie selection was fine but has room for improvement. FA's were brilliant professional attentive actually charming and regularly present in the cabin with drinks sandwiches snacks ice-cream etc. Meals served were tasty and with a Swiss touch. Lunch was Salmon Tarter (and two other choices) and Swiss Sturgeon (or Beef Tenderloin or Swiss Style Chicken Breast or Vegetable Curry). The second meal was a less interesting choice of Penne or Ceasars's Salad. It always nice to be served some local tastes and not just generic airline food. Wines served were also nice including some Swiss choices. LX uses the shared Servisair lounge in AMS which although comfortable offers just an OK drinks selection and a neglectable food selection. Due to the short connection time in ZRH we did not use lounge in ZRH. Transferring in ZRH is fast and easy. Border Control was friendly and with no waiting time also no additional transfer security control for passengers arriving from other Schengen countries a breeze. Terminals are roomy and well designed. Probably one of the very best airports in Europe for a transfer connection. Excellent long-haul product by LX and clearly recommended. LX is truly the gem of the Lufthansa Group of airlines (LH 4U OS SN and LX).,0,10,R Simon,2015-03-17,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,I flew ZRH-MIA on a 330-300. Seating in first class is 1-2-1 which is a great configuration. The seats are great and very stylish with light wood panelling. Boarding was on time with priority lane. The crew was extremely nice and welcoming. Also very professional. Drinks and food are ok but not up to standard when compared to other European carriers first class. In my experience Lufthansa and Air France serve much better food in their first class. Full flat seats are very comfortable and feels like a real bed with a nice duvet and real size pillow. Amenity kits are the same since at least 5 years with La Prairie products. Large screens are great for watching movies. Entertainment system is good also. Light snack served before landing to Miami. All in all it was a very nice flight. Too bad the food is not as good as it should be. Otherwise in my opinion they would be the best airline in Europe for first class because the flight attendants are very good.,0,10,Ozsezen Ender,2015-03-09,yes,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,3,N/A,5,3,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flew business class on LX from Delhi to Barcelona via Zurich. The flight from Delhi to Zurich was on an A330 in seat 4A. Since its a late night flight the crew doesn't offer dinner unless you ask for it which could be an irritant for some. The breakfast (ordered in advance) was good but nothing special. The wines and chocolates served were top notch. The amenity kit was functional with what low budget items. The single seat is extremely private and very spacious though was a little too hard to sleep comfortably on. The crew is extremely polite and efficient though so no complaints there. The ZRH-BCN flight was an A320 with standard economy seating with the middle seat taken out. Breakfast served on the flight was significantly better than the offering on the much longer DEL-ZRH flight with the bircher muesli in particular standing out.,0,8,Devottam Sengupta,2015-03-04,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,MXP-ZRH-DXB on Economy class. First flight with Avro RJ100: I don't like this aircraft but for a 35-minutes flight I can stand. Standard service for a European flight departure and arrival on time. Transit in ZRH quite fast without additional security controls. Departure from terminal E connected by shuttle train to the main building. In 20 mins I was from my aircraft to the departure gate. Visit to Panorama Lounge: poor food selection but good Wi-fi. We flew to DXB on a A330: comfortable seats polite and professional service. The food was serve after 1h30 min and I think that was very good. The IFE has an interesting content but the quality of the screen could be improved. I personally don't like to use the remote control but it was easy. Right before landing we've been served a delicious ice-cream. Overall I've been satisfied.,0,9,M Emiliano,2015-02-12,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flew November 2014 from Singapore to Zurich economy and from Zurich to Hong Kong business class on the return. All I can say is thankfully this airline does not fly to Australia as if they did I probably would never fly again. Compared to Singapore and Cathay Pacific which I flew with as well on this trip there is no comparison. The staff on Swiss Air were extremely rude. I was informed that I was a vegetarian and I had ordered a special meal. When I said I hadn't they said there might not be a spare meal for me. This is in business class. On the plus side the seat was good. Entertainment not as good as other airlines. Drinks were served very sparingly.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,We travelled with my two infants from Zurich to Delhi. I couldn't select my seat while doing web check-in as this is not allowed if you are traveling with infants. So I requested a bassinet seat to the ground staff while doing baggage drop. He said all those seats had already been purchased. Next hassle while boarding. Swiss doesn't do priority boarding for passengers traveling with babies. The flight crew were very nice and helped to swap my wife's seat with a bassinet seat. I requested the Swiss customer service book a bassinet seat for myself as well however they could only do so for my wife I was told to to contact customer care in Switzerland where I could book a seat next to her at an additional 10% fare.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"Zurich to Cairo return in Economy Class. SWISS recently downgraded the route from A340 widebody to A320 narrowbody. The outcome is very low-cost like. Seats are incredibly cramped and uncomfortable the hot meal has been sacrificed for a ""new concept"" cold snack offered in a box and there is no entertainment except from the overhead screens (that's Tom & Jerry for you a few advertisements and the moving map). Staff have now become indifferent and the aisle has also become congested with passengers waiting to use the few toilets on board (including the only Business Class toilet). Forget paying for Business Class if you're flying this route on this aircraft: passengers are treated to the exact same seats as the ones in Economy Class (with the same pitch but the middle seat left empty) unless you can justify paying more than three times the amount for a hot meal and lounge access. SWISS is also charging Economy passengers a lot for booking seats in advance. There are better op tions to Cairo: BA Air France KLM and even (some) EgyptAir flights continue to operate widebodies from Europe and offer decent levels of comfort. SWISS has completely lost the plot and are now offering a standard Euro product for a 4 hour intercontinental flight.",0,2,Soliman Sam,2014-12-01,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,2,3,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,I flew Swiss a few weeks ago from Zurich to Bucharest on a one-way flight. Having paid 825 Euros for my ticket the services offered on-board as well as Swiss' overall product were a complete letdown despite the fact that I flew Economy. The on-board service consisted of a small cheese sandwich that was disgusting as the cheese was visibly going bad however a nice selection of drinks was offered. The flight attendants were pretty nice! Flight landed in Bucharest on-time and the flight was operated by a clean A320 aircraft.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,ZRH-HAM. Friendly and accommodating crew with good drinks selection and a snack. Overall the Lufthansa Group's ground-crew policy of outsourcing check-in services to the cheapest provider counteracts the excellent on-board service: In my row in economy we were 3 Star-Gold customers (visible on our boarding passes) sandwiched next to each other. One look to the rear of the plane revealed that nearly all middle seats on the plane were empty. This seating practice leaves the impression that status-customers are being punished for their loyalty.,0,4,I Thernot,2014-11-20,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,3,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flight LX22/23 Geneva-New York JFK (return). I was seated on the first row of economy section. Enough space to lay my legs and first to be served. The meal was correct. I've the feeling that I always eat the same on Swiss economy chicken or pasta. Swiss Taste of Switzerland should be applied in economy class too. The staff were friendly and very professional as usual. As an example I wanted to buy cigarettes at the inflight duty-free shop and the flight attendant was not sure if my brand was still available. He promised to come back later to tell me if yes or not he came back one hour later telling me that they were not available and he even checked in business and first class too so kind! The inflight Entertainment is good too a lot of choice. Unfortunately compared to the competition I think that the screens are too small with a low resolution unfortunately. Better with Lufthansa. Swiss is a very good airline I'm never disappointed. However several little things should be improved if LX wish to keep its leadership in Europe.,0,7,Moser Randy,2014-11-17,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,It was nobody's fault that take off from Pudong to Zurich was delayed due to technical problems. Waiting for 3 hours on the plane with virtually no service of drinks snacks etc. was not up to standard. Swiss' old first class seats are very dated and worn. No privacy screen very poor monitor and very limited choice of video / movie entertainment. Missed connections in Zurich were very efficiently rebooked and information was available on arrival. No invitation no information was offered to first class passengers to the first class lounge at Zurich airport. Not knowing that a first class lounge exists I just searched and only found the business / senator lounge on arrival. Totally overcrowded limited choice of food and beverage no shower facilities in my view very inappropriate for first class service. Given a choice I will definitely not choose Swiss for First until and unless there is a serious upgrade in inflight and arrival comfort.,0,3,Ekkehard Goetting,2014-11-12,no,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,4,3,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flew from SFO-ZRH on the Airbus 340. This was my first time on Swiss and won't be my last. I have flown in First and Business Class with most major airlines and Swiss is one of the best. We had 4 flights total with Swiss (2 longhaul and 2 intra-European) and on each flight the cabin crew were so professional friendly and smiling the whole time. The Business Class seats are very nice and contemporary. Food was in general very good and well- presented. We did have two minor quibbles. The menu that we were given said that ice cream would be provided but we never saw it. Also the IFE is clumsy and outdated. I used it for maybe an hour total and then just read and slept the rest of the time. Swiss really goes out of their way to represent Switzerland and they do a great job. Also transiting their hub at Zurich is very easy.,0,9,M Bragg,2014-10-31,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,I flew to Istanbul and back in mid-October. It was a short notice trip as such I had no checked luggage so I can't comment on that. My seat was 2A on both legs of the trip. The seat is a normal economy class seat though the pitch is only marginally better than in economy class and definitely much worse than in exit row. Seat comfort was the same as Swiss economy which is to say not great at all. The food consisted of a regional Swiss vegetarian dish and a standard chicken dish with a nice dessert. Portions were small cutlery etc was good though. I paid a fairly low price for my semi-flexible (mid of the range) D class ticket. The value is pretty good if you need to carry a lot of baggage as you may check in 2 times 32kg and carry on 2 times 8kg. In comparison to other airlines such as Turkish airlines business class in Swiss is not ideal. Service quality was unexpectedly blunderous with an almost overly friendly cabin chief and a totally inadequate business class FA who couldn't even recall whether alpha is on port or starboard and was desperately searching for some imaginary economy class guest who may have been lost in business class (why anyone would attempt that on Swiss in Europe is a mystery to me - though it's possible as an accident since the seats in business and economy are identical). Best seats in any Swiss European flight are exit row seats. Have a healthy meal at the airport before take-off and get much better value.,0,3,B Baser,2014-10-31,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,1,2,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,The airline is fine. But their ground support in airports such as Barcelona (and others) needs to be seriously addressed. Once again on arriving at Barcelona from Zurich on the evening of 25th October 2014 the checked in bags took well over 45 minutes to arrive. (The terminal was not busy as we arrived at 22:30 so there is no excuse). Unfortunately this is standard for this airport - but the airlines have the influence to suggest to the airport or their handlers that this is a poor service.

The same rude flight attendant lady scolded me for having my bag in front of my seat (I was in an exit row) when the plane was preparing for landing.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flying from CDG to DXB in economy on Swiss: Travelers be warned. Swiss at CDG only has a 23kg weight limit and the staff are extremely severe at enforcing this. No amount of negotiation was going to get my case on board without a hefty fee of 150 Euros even though I was only a few grams over after packing my case. Swiss feels like a very low budget airline and their lack of any flexibility whatsoever was frustrating. The worst part is that Swiss do not allow you to have a carry-on plus a laptop. Only one bag so I was forced to cram my laptop bag into my carry-on. A futile activity as I just took it out again after security.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,We selected Swiss for our trip to Athens Greece (MUC-ZRH-ATH ATH-GVA-MUC) and we were really happy to fly them for the first time. I am however very disappointed with the airline. Both LX flights were delayed by or over 30 mins no explanation/excuse. The ZRH-ATH sector was on a new A321 with minimum cabin crew of 4 (instead of 5) so only 3 in the Y class. The cabin crew were uncoordinated (they were demonstrating the oxygen masks while the purser was announcing the life vest use) and the food service began from the forward towards the aft cabin and food collection was from aft to forward which means that we had to eat like animals. The food was a joke - an over-seasoned risotto that was only three spoons' size and a muffin. Drinks service - only one drink/cup per passenger and coffee/tea service 40 mins prior to arrival - for a 02.40 hours flight. For comparison LH OS A3 offer at least two drinks per passenger usually you get an additional drink with coffee or tea. The Crew was ignorant of the passengers two of them snappy they didn't bother to ask the passengers to raise their seatbacks for food service. Chaos in the aisle passengers not respecting the service but the crew didn't bother. Passengers almost climbed on seats to move across the trolley. The ATH-GVA sector was a bit friendlier but the crew were incapable of serving drinks without constantly spilling drinks on the floor. They also hurried the food/drink service in order to start the duty-free sales asking almost every passenger to buy something. Of all airlines I have flown with Swiss was unfortunately the worst.,0,3,Doukas Alexios,2014-10-13,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,1,4,Swiss International Air Lines

Very enjoyable flights partly due of course to the wonderful scenery on this journey especially Zurich to Geneva. Service was generally good although often one was being served with no eye contact from the cabin crew who were otherwise busy chatting to friends - not professional! The return flight from Geneva to Zurich was delayed over an hour and I was treated rather patronisingly when I asked at the Business Lounge for help as I had important connections in both Zurich and more importantly out of Vienna that same evening. Luckily they then found me an alternate flight in order to make my connections otherwise I would have been in a real mess (and one of my rules of thumb is never to make flights with even remotely tight connections!).

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,My husband and I flew from Los Angeles to Zurich changed plane to Venice on September 1 2014. Then we both flew again Swiss Airlines from Rome to Zurich changed plane to Los Angeles on September 17 2014. We booked Swiss after reading rave reviews and we paid a higher fare than other airlines. This was absolutely disappointing. 1) Meals were horrible - lousy and tasteless pasta cold and hard chocolate brioche for breakfast. Calzone was hot but no substance inside - a big lump of dough. Green tea? Nope! You have to be in first class in order to have green tea - as I was told by the FA! 2) Seats are narrow with no cushion at all. 3) Outdated entertainment onboard. 4) No boarding organization from Zurich to Venice or Rome to Zurich. People tried to jam the boarding gate. Once you boarded you have to wait a long long time for people who sit in the front to get settle before you can reach your seat in the back. 5) FA with rude demeanour from Los Angeles to Zurich. We have flown Air Canada American Airlines British Airways Cathy Pacific Airlines numerous times. This was our first time and will be the last time with Swiss because it was the most disappointing and uncomfortable flights.,0,1,S Cheng,2014-10-05,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,1,1,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,ATH-ZRH-JFK - generally wonderful flights. The first flight left a little late so we arrived to Zurich about 15 minutes late. Not a huge deal.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flew MAN-ZRH-DEL with wife and 2 kids on 9th August 2014. The MAN-ZRH leg operated by Helvetic Airways on behalf of Swiss. Good service and good snack served during flight. The kids were taken good care of. ZRH Airport is a nightmare to connect flights. Had an hour to catch a connecting flight so were literally running for the next flight. No proper signage as well as no officials to ask directions we ended up on the arrivals level looking for the gate to top it all the security made us scan the baggage again before going to departures opening the duty free purchases again and scanning the liquor bottles. Anyway once at the gate and boarding the onward flight things were back to normal. Good service food entertainment. Would definitely recommend the airline but not Zurich airport.

Good space between seats and the smiling Swiss crew offered to all the passengers a croissant with all the drinks we want. Departure and arrival on time. Transfer on Zurich went really smooth. Flight Zurich- Istanbul on an A320. Again normal economy seat with good space and the crew offered us Rissoto al pesto with an apple cake and all the drinks we want. We arrived on time.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,GVH-ZRH-CDG and back. Flight left and arrived late in Zurich same applies to connecting flight to Paris. Seats are small and crew were grumpy. I actually had a FA openly yawn at me while boarding the flight to Paris - not very welcoming. I can understand that one can be tiered but I would expect an FA to at least turn the head away or conceal the yawn with something. Crew not smiling and mostly looking bored loudly discussing amongst themselves how bad their schedule is. Saw a lady traveling solo with 2 small children instead of assisting her with the seat belts one crew member just stood there looking annoyed while giving her orders adding insult to injury actually commencing to loudly complain to a colleague about a non existing situation (kids did nothing wrong). I will give Swiss a miss until they start training their staff in customer service.,0,3,Lucia Mammola,2014-09-17,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,0,N/A,1,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Swiss LX178 ZRH-SIN on Sept 4 and LX179 SIN-ZRH Sept 14 2014. Reservation not satisfactory at all first of all there is no special hotline for first class passengers so you always need to wait for long time to get an agent. Then any request (also very basic) was difficult to get done. In particular I never got a follow up or feedback on my requests and had to call several times to follow up. Staff on the hotline are sometimes OK sometimes not friendly at all and had a lack of client orientation. Lounge in ZRH is very good design food good with good wine selection service OK. Lounge in SIN is very disappointing old and outdated design bad food choice and quality very poor wine selection. Cabin layout very outdated no luxury at all seat very old and not very comfortable; no luxury amenities at all (toilet without any mouth wash hand cream or lip balm etc). Food below average worse than business class. There is no food available after dinner if you wake up during the flight so you need to go on your own to get something from business class - not really first level. Good wine selection and quality. Staff this time (both legs) very friendly and helpful - there is a big difference from crew to crew so you need to be lucky to get a good crew - this should not be the case in First Class. Conclusion: disappointing I cannot recommend Swiss and find it clearly below other airlines first class.,0,3,T Gubser,2014-09-17,no,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,3,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Used Swiss to fly from Geneva to Los Angeles for a family visit and vacation. We tend to use Swiss for our trips as it is convenient reliable and we believe good value for money spent. We were not disappointed. The flights were on time the pre flight service excellent and on board we couldn't have asked for more. Business class is quiet comfortable and provides a good ambience to survive a 10+ hour trip. The only area of improvement would be the entertainment with more choices and certainly more recent releases.,0,9,N Vanian,2014-09-14,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,JNB-ZRH-CDG in August. Very disappointed for all aspects of the flights especially long-haul. Seats are very narrow and hard. While the seating or relaxing position are good the sleeping one is very strange. The whole seat goes down close to the floor. I had a feeling to be lying in a coffin. Entertainment system was very slow crashed several times. Meal service was just ok started with a glass of wine (or champagne) and a cheap-feeling packet of nuts supermarket style. Even American airlines propose better prepared appetisers!. Three hours before landing the crew started to dismantle the whole galley behind us with continual clicks and clacks. I guess its a kind of game they had - who can make more noise when preparing breakfast. No idea who actually won but for sure all passengers lost at least one hour of sleep. Why serve breakfast two hours before landing? During the short- haul European flights they manage to serve the meal during 50 minutes long flights why not to do the same on long-haul flights? Long waiting for toilets: there are only two for both business cabins. All in all very disappointed experience.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flew from San Diego to Chicago on United First and then Chicago overnight to Zurich on Swiss. We were a family of four and seated in the small business cabin just behind First. Excellent service from the cabin crew who were very attentive to my son. I like the seats themselves although they are on the narrow side. The in-flight entertainment is outdated and limited but the positive aspects of the flight were the crew and the seamless connections either side of the flight.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flight 197 on 19 Aug 2014. The most uncomfortable 10+hour flight I have ever experienced. Okay so it was an economy seat but the seat spacing was extremely tight and the seats cushions were old and uncomfortable. The arrangement of Airbus 330 had no standing areas to comfortably stretch your legs without constantly moving out of the way of the lavatory door ways. Also there was no path to cross over to the other aisle so that I could not easily visit my friend on the other side of the aircraft. The flight attendants were clumsy who were stingy with food and drink. I chose this airline and paid over 50% more than the other carrier options because I expected a higher quality experience and comfortable flight but I guess I expected far too much.,0,1,J Collins,2014-09-01,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,1,1,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,JFK-Zurich-Budapest-Zurich-JFK 330 plane - first time on Swiss in some years - leg from JFK to Zurich on aisle seat with box underneath - extremely narrow seat most uncomfortable. Passenger in front of me placed his seat back immediately upon boarding throughout flight (save for takeoff and landing) so one could hardly move. My reading light bounced off the back of that passengers seat when in recline position so I had hardly any light at all for overnight reading. Food quality much deteriorated from years past served on minute tray (and nothing like the old glorious Swissair Flights - bland chicken or pasta iceberg lettuce wrapped brownie - same mediocre level as Delta far worse than Air France or KLM. Breakfast just a warm bun. Inflight entertainment adequate. Service average. Return transatlantic flight in bulkhead so no legroom issues. European Flights Zurich-Budapest had drink service but only miniscule snack and chocolate in shape of soccer ball (world cup ongoing at the time). Positives - reserved seats honored planes very clean easy transfer at Zurich Airport. Probably in future will return to KLM Air France Austrian maybe Lufthansa rather than attempting another Swiss International transatlantic crossing as it no longer seems to be a first-rate airline.,0,4,W Staab,2014-08-28,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,4,3,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Swiss is superb! For me the best European airline. On this 2+ hour flight from Zurich to Athens on an A321 the service was impeccable as was the meal. The ingredients were fresh and the meal well presented. Also loved the choice of wines. The seats are the standard European business class where the middle seat is empty however it was very comfortable.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"I flew business with my wife and 15-year old son from New York to Zurich (on August 12/13) and the next day (business again) from Zurich to Athens Greece. Although I had read that the service and comfort level in Swiss business class is one of the best in Europe I did not have the same experience in my flight. First I noticed that my son's headset was not working so he wad to be moved to another seat. Then my headset seemed somewhat out of order as something heavy (probably the speaker within the earpiece) was displaced and moved freely every time I turned my head. Although the flight from N.Y. to Zurich was 8-hour long both dinner and breakfast were way below what someone would expect from Swiss business class both in terms of quantity but mainly in quality. There were only few business class travelers in this flight (less than 20 if I remember correctly) but still the crew seemed tired and was only ""typically"" polite trying just to ""get their thing done"". I had a much better and far more enjoyable experience about a month ago when traveling from Athens to Vienna and on to New York with Austrian airlines. Austrian's service was way more friendly genuinely polite and very helpful and their meals were far better that Swiss's. Also Austrian featured touch-screen TVs with newer movies and live in-flight information something that was missing from Swiss. It is a shame that the reputation and high service standards of Swiss were not present in my flights and I truly hope that this was just a very rare and exceptional incident.",0,4,Christakis Alex,2014-08-28,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,2,N/A,3,2,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,We paid for 3 seats in Business Class and I can't believe I didn't fly my usual choice. Swiss show a picture of a throne-like seat on their website and represent that as their Business Class seat. But there are just a few of these in the cabin and the other seats are different. You can't get the seats they show on the web site only their senior frequent flyers. So my wife and baby were stuck in a middle seat with an unfortunate stranger next to them despite me having reserved the lone window seat online. The seats themselves are lumpy and uncomfortable and the in-flight entertainment is the worst I've seen. It is painfully slow clunky and simply doesn't work much of the time (we took two long haul legs Zurich - Singapore and Hong Kong - Zurich and this was true on both legs). The food is ok though not a patch on what you'd get on Emirates Qatar or one of the first-tier airlines. Swiss have no lounges of their own outside of Switzerland so in Hong Kong we ended up being sent to a packed noisy pay-per-entry lounge which had no seats was utter chaos and had one type of beer in the fridge. When we disembarked in Zurich we were told with no apology at all that we'd miss our connection to Manchester because Swiss were late arriving. My wife left her bag on the plane accidentally in our rush to get off. 5 minutes later we told a Swiss ground employee that the bag had been left in Business Class and would they mind retrieving it. They passed me a card for a third party lost and found company called Swissport and was told to file a web report with them when I was back in the UK. Two days later and still no info on what should have been the easiest thing in the world to solve.

The only negative aspects were the economy seats and the entertainment. I am 180 cm tall and felt that there was limited space. There was very little legroom.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,26th June my colleague and I were flying from Dubai to Zurich. The plane's seats were tiny even though I am only 1.74 metres and weigh 72kg. Once onboard the pilot informed us that all passengers would have to leave the aircraft one by one to identify their bags as there were 3 extra bags that they could not identify. The plane was going to be at least 3 hours late which meant that we were going to miss our connecting flight in Zurich therefore missing our business meeting in Prague. We informed the staff that we would like to leave the plane as there was no point in flying if we were going to miss our meeting in Prague.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,ZRH-SFO April 26 2014 in First: First Lounge in ZRH excellent very nice decor excellent food and good service. Very good is also the car shuttle to the gate. Flight: Very old layout of cabin seats are very old and dated without any touch of luxury. There is very limited privacy between the seats. The TV screen is very small. The seat adjustment panel shows its age some buttons do not work properly. The toilets have also absolutely no luxury features they look more like economy than first class very limited amenities (only one hand lotion and one face lotion but no lip balm no mouth wash etc.) after some hours they are out of tissues so you have to use paper tissues - very economy style! Amenities OK but again no luxury. The pyjamas are good quality. Food is OK but not on First standard (same choice and quality as Business Class). Limited choice. The chicken had absolutely no taste the rice also tasteless - overall really not good. Good is the quality of the wines. During the flight there is no food available - worse than in Business Class where they serve sandwiches etc. Service very disappointing: 3 empty water bottles remained for more than 5 hours beside me. The maitre de cabin however was nice and tried to accommodate us as much as possible. Overall very disappointing far away from Premium airlines like Emirates Etihad and Singapore Airlines. The First experience is at most on Business level of these Premium airlines.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,On leaving Mumbai we were given a modest meal. I asked for a glass of red wine knowing that the airline has a great Italian vintage. The stewardess served me just a glass of wine instead of bringing the bottle and serving the wine from the bottle. We were asked to fill out a form indicating our breakfast order. I checked out the boxes for (a) regular coffee and (b) with milk. The next morning my breakfast was served without coffee. The stewardess bought just a cup and the coffee spilt over the papers that I had laid out on the table adjacent to my seat. I tasted the coffee. It was cold. I requested another cup indicating that it should be served with a saucer. This time the coffee was served hot. The coffee should have been served in the first place in a cup with a saucer. What is the point of making me fill out a form in advance and then not serving me with my order?

I am 5 ft. tall and weigh 125 lbs. The very large people in front of me both reclined their seats the moment we were allowed and the man's head was literally in my lap - so close I could no longer hold a book in front of me but also had to recline and hold the book up. The lack of space for even a person of below average size was unacceptable. At meal time they made everyone put their seats upright as trays could not be opened with a seat in front of you reclined.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"ZRH-NCE 08.55am departure 28 June 2014. Selected because they are the sole full-service airline flying this route non-stop. At boarding gate at ZRH agent refused to let me onboard with my carry-on size rollaboard - which I've used for years and which no airline has ever previously refused to let me take onboard. I was rudely asked to step aside to tag and check the bag at the gate - ""This is a small plane today"" actually it was a regular A320. When trying to board later of course my boarding pass did not scan in - extra delay and hassle. Once I boarded I saw that overhead bins were mostly empty (and there were plenty of empty seats). No food except a croissant and a mini chocolate offered (by perfunctory and non-smiling staff). No IFE. Despite LX's obsession with checking carryon-size bags departed gate at ZRH late and landed at NCE approximately 15 min late. Followed by 20 min wait at baggage claim for the bag.

The issue was that in a 38 seat business cabin 20% of the seats were occupied by young children. The according disturbance of noise from electronic games alarms crying and children wandering around and over seats ruined sleep for myself and others on the flight.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,My wife and I booked a flight on the Edelweiss flight direct from Tampa to/from Zurich with Swiss. We chose to use Swiss primarily because they are a Star Alliance member and I am a Gold Premier member. We were assigned poor seats didn't get priority boarding or any of the other perks that are supposed to come with Gold Premier status. When I contacted Swiss about this I was advised all the information we relied on in choosing Swiss was incorrect. So even though we paid Swiss which issued the tickets and the plane was referenced as a Swiss flight there were no Star Alliance benefits and I would not receive any miles. As to the Swiss affiliate Edelweiss the plane was hot cramped uncomfortable and all drinks were a charge for this 10-hour flight. This was on the way to and from. To add insult to injury the staff were cold and short even for people from Central Europe and Edelweiss will allow the Economy Plus (Extra) to go empty rather than upgrade anyone with Star Alliance status. Instead they want $200 per person per way. The Economy Plus on our return flight was empty yet they ran out of food (unless you want curry on a 10-hour flight) and we were only 3 rows back from the front of Economy. In short we will never fly Swiss or Edelweiss again. Better bet out of Tampa is to drive to Orlando and take the direct on Lufthansa to Frankfurt.,0,Brak oceny,Benjamin Jilek,2014-07-08,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,1,N/A,1,2,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flight LX 454 Zurich to London City Airport on 16 June 2014. We boarded the plane as normal welcomed onboard and told we were ready to take off despite an earlier bird strike in one of the engines. Informed there was a 20-minute delay due to changing weather conditions. 15 minutes into the flight the pilot announced that we were returning to Zurich as the earlier bird strike had apparently damaged the engine too much. Then we had to be patient for an extra half hour due to the heavy incoming traffic to Zurich. In the end it took us what felt like the same amount of time as the flight would have taken to London. To offer an alternative a crew member announced that we should take the next scheduled flight to London Heathrow at 21.20 hrs. There was no alternative to London City allegedly due to lack of smaller aircraft that could land there. The hostess also announced that as soon as we land we should go straight to gate 31D to board the new flight stressing the point about going straight to that gate twice. I decided to go to Heathrow so I rushed along many other passengers to gate 31D and queued up only to find the gate unattended. 20 minutes later a staff member appeared and told us we should go gate 53D get our new boarding passes there and come back to gate 31D for boarding. While providing us with our new boarding passes the staff at gate 53D also gave us a food and refreshment voucher by way of compensation they said. These were valid for the coffee bar across the hall. So we all went to the coffee bar and queued up there to get our “ free”food and drink. Alas we found out that the vouchers was valid for a bar of chocolate and bottle of water. The time was after 8 pm. I was the last passenger to get a new boarding pass I got seat 36B which is a middle seat in the last row. The best seat in town. Finally took off at 21.55 hrs. We touched down in London Heathrow about 22.30 local time. It was about half past midnight by the time I got to my destination.,0,2,Massumi David,2014-07-06,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,1,N/A,2,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,ZRH-CPH C class on a slightly tired Airbus. Departure from ZRH 1 hour late due late incoming aircraft. Crew was outstanding - Purser came and explained the reason for the delay and apologized accordingly. The whole crew were very friendly and highly professional.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,We flew LX 180 - Zurich to Bangkok on 20 June 2014 - a code share flight - we had booked Thai Airways Sydney to Zurich. We were seated in 33J and 33K The aircraft appeared tired and the seating is very restrictive. With the person in front reclined it is impossible to use the seat table. I sat in seat 33K and found there is a positive - we left on time and arrived on time but we do not wish to repeat the 10 hours in between that the handset was missing. A broken piece of plastic remained attached to some wiring - as it was a full flight we could not be offered a change of seat. The cabin crew appeared to be efficient but by the end of the trip I would rather describe them as glacially indifferent. Food quality served on silly little trays was very poor and small things like no salt or pepper sachet shows a lack of quality control somewhere. The toilet nearest to us ran out of toilet paper. Yet again a poor reflection upon Swiss flight crew. On the positive side we left on time and arrived on time but we do not want to repeat the 10 hours in between. Better seating and re-focused cabin crew would help.,0,2,Terence Potesta,2014-07-01,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,3,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"(LAX to LHR on United) LHR-ZRH (A320) - JNB (A340) Business class. Outstanding customer service - the purser on the flight from London to Zurich detected a glitch in the onward booking before the plane had landed and the (minor) problem (owing to booking through UA in the USA) was fixed before the plane landed! (It would not have been a crisis either way). Transit IN ZRH: international transit (Euro gates incl UK to Pier E) is not so well signposted as there is an escalator to the left of the immigration hall that saves one from clearing immig/customs and re-entering which happened to a few other transit passengers who didn't notice the escalator sign. Watch out for the sign to Terminal E! A340 Business: Staggered seats arrangement if on an aisle seat try to select one with the arm rest console on the aisle side yourself for extra distance from the aisle. Seats are narrower than some - a little on the hard side but fully flat and ""cosy"". Entertainment on demand and a large choice even for those of us who fly often in the same movie/month cycle.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,We just finished flying LAX-Zurich-Rome and Venice-Zurich-LA on the way back). Several of those legs were delayed but only by a few minutes each and they were honestly apologetic about even that much so I'm not complaining. All the cabin staff was friendly and helpful. Food was decent by ground standards but mind blowingly good by economy seat on a plane standards compared to other airlines I've flown. We got a full meal and a sandwich going one way and a meal a sandwich and ice cream going the other way - all several steps above edible. Free booze on the longer legs too! (Various little bottles of spirits plus the house red/white wines. Wines merely drinkable spirits were fairly classy considering we were in coach and they were free. If you want Campari though I learned you have to grab it quickly as they always ran out. Checking in our bags at LAX was the most painless experience I've had checking in. Zurich airport by contrast is surprisingly a bit of a madhouse but while the lines there were long once we figured out which line to stand in it also moved remarkably quickly so we weren't in line for too long. I would definitely fly with SWISS again unless one of the other small handful of respectable airlines were way cheaper. That said not everything was perfect: their website was having issues all the time (we had to call to get our confirmation numbers and to reserve seats because their web reservation system was all kinds of buggy). Our seats on the transatlantic flights were quite cramped (I'm extremely thankful we got seats that were only 2 across or the flight would have been hell. It was still a bit cramped even just me and my wife.) The transatlantic flights also didn't have individual seat-controllable air and as a result got rather stuffy one of the flights.,0,8,Adam Field,2014-05-23,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,5,N/A,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Zurich-Montreal return in A330-300. My first experience with the SWISS long haul business product and very impressed. On the outgoing flight the Maitre de Cabine personally came around addressed every passenger in C by name and wished everybody a most pleasant flight. The meals on long haul flights leaving Zurich are prepared by starred chefs accompanied by good quality Swiss wines which are hard to get outside of Switzerland. Of course on the flight back meal quality is not in this luxury range though adequate. The new business seat converts to a fully flat bed I couldn't wish for more.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Clean plane. Pleasant crew. Food and entertainment are good. Seats were narrow and not well padded but considering that planes are designed as mass public transport in the air - can't complain too much. We really liked Zurich Airport as a transit point to other destinations. It is small modern and not at all chaotic like some of the bigger transit airports. If you land during the day and have a window seat you get a fabulous view of the Alps.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,I was pleasantly satisfied with Swiss Airline the flights were always clean and on time the crew very friendly and always smiling. Another highly positive aspect of flying with Swiss airline is that you get plenty of leg space (compared to other airlines) and the seats are very comfortable even on short distance routes which shows that Swiss airline is one of the few airlines these days which doesn't compromise quality. We got free Swiss chocolates from the crew as well as sandwiches and drinks. However the sandwiches contained either meat or cheese and that was disappointing for a vegan like me so I would like to see animal-free meal choices next time I fly with Swiss. I would definitely fly with Swiss again and I would definitely recommend Swiss airline to everyone.,0,10,Khatoon Khazeema,2014-05-11,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,4,5,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,ORD-ZRH on an A330. Pros: Flight was on time. Cabin service was performed with the usual Swiss efficiency - meal service was quickly served and cleaned up which allowed plenty of time to sleep without interruption. Food was actually very good - dinner was choice of chicken and rice or Swiss dumplings with vegetables and cheese sauce. The dumplings were quite good served in a generous portion with a salad roll and dessert. Also offered a nice variety compared to usual economy fare. Cons: Seats were very narrow and a bit hard though the legroom was adequate. It was tolerable for this flight but would have been very cramped had the flight been any longer.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,LX 288 ZRH-JNB May 6th 2014. Business class. A really good flight in an A330 with the now excellent flat beds and space. The food wine and the service were excellent with a 30 minute early arrival at JNB. The starboard seats are the ones to go for as they are single. The only criticism I have - a Swiss IA responsibility though the service is subcontracted - is that in the business lounge there is free wi-fi but only for 60 consecutive minutes. After that there is a charge. As I had a 5hr wait this was very inconvenient. Surely having pitched up a business class fare they could at least emulate many high street coffee shops and provide unlimited wi-fi without charge. it's not a big charge in the context of the fare more a matter of principle.,0,9,Jeff Williams,2014-05-07,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Zurich to Stockholm April 11. The equipment used on this service was an Airbus A321-100 and I was seated on 4F in Business Class. Flight scheduled 16.35-19.00 but was delayed due to late incoming aircraft so actual time was 16.55-19.20. The travelling experience was generally very good. Swiss offers a traditional full in-service business product also on intra-European flights. This includes a 3 course meal which was very tasteful and included a selection between to hot main dishes. The only thing that is lacking is the timing in the service. No pre-dinner drinks or snacks were offered these had to be ordered at the same time as the meal was served which took quite some time into the flight. The timing of serving coffee/tea was also not as to be expected. The service level in general from the cabin staff I regard as lower than expected. They do their job in a correct Swiss manner but it lacked the sprit and enthusiasm that you would expect from such a well renowned carrier as Swiss. Cabin was clean and tidy and the middle seat was free in Business Class and the seat pitch was good. The seats are however the same as in Economy that is Recaro Slim Seats with artificial leather that to my opinion is not especially comfortable. The same type of seats can be found on several Star Alliance airlines within Europe. They offer no support for your head so if you would like to take a short nap bring your own pillow. An in-flight entertainment system was offered with overhead screens that was ok. Overall though a good experience that however can be improved by quite small measures.,0,8,Gustafsson Magnus,2014-04-13,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,3,5,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Istanbul-Zurich-Warsaw. Both flights on nice and clean Airbus 320. Cabin crew nice not over enthusiastic or over friendly just did their job. Both flights on time. Food rather poor From Istanbul tiny portion of hot pasta arrabiata with muffin served inedible. To Warsaw - tiny sandwich. The best part of service was a chocolate. The only downpoint is Swiss' obsession with cabin baggage. They fly the same airplane type as any other airlines but their fights and constant quite unpleasant arguments with passengers to check-in cabin bags are horrendous. Such strict policies I have seen only with the low cost airlines. Swiss does it for no reason as other airlines see no problems where Swiss does.

The connection flight to Bangkok was perfect to staff were very friendly and attentive. The Menu served was good in taste. The seats and the flat bed were very comfortable and easy to operate. Unfortunately the onboard entertainment system was a bit old and slow. The screen was very small and the picture quality bad. Flight from Tokyo to Zurich was very well organized.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,London City to Stuttgart via Zurich in economy was a bit of a curate's egg. The 0730 departure from city left late with no reason landing on time in Zurich. Service with only one crew in economy was slow (and unusually the Cabin Manager not heading back to assist. soft / hot drinks were served though only a muffin offered as food which I think for a 0730 departure is poor by Swiss standards. Cabin secure on the swiss legs was non existent but very thorough on the helvetic legs. Excellent connecting flights in Zurich both ways with Helvetic on immaculate F100 aircraft. Loads of room a smart interior (grey leather seats and red carpet) was spotless along with friendly crew. The return leg from Zurich to City was late leaving due to a PAX miscount with a small dry filled roll and drinks served. Looking forward to the new aircraft due on this route (C series) which starts next year. I think the service has marginally declined since I last flew this route with BA out of city offering a better product.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"LX1254 Zurich-Stockholm on March 27. Flight departed Zurich on time at 16.35 and arrived slightly before scheduled arrival time at 19.00 at Stockholm Arlanda Airport. Aircraft on this service was an Airbus A320 and I was seated in Economy on seat 10F (a window seat). Flights were more or less fully booked so it was rather cramped and the overhead bins became full before all passengers had boarded. This is quite normal on this particular flight since the load factor is normally very good thus meaning that it may become somewhat uncomfortable for you as a passenger. The standard of the aircraft was good and the seat pitch is perceived to be marginally better than the average carrier on intra-European routes. This may however only depend on the seat design. I have not checked the pitch compared to other airlines. A simple hot vegetable tart was served that in fact was quite tasty. Two rounds of services with both hot and cold drinks were offered during this 2 hr 20 min flight which I appreciated. The spirit and level of personal service and attention of the cabin crew I regard as slightly below the average full-service carrier on intra-European services. An in-flight overhead entertainment system were installed which was ok. The in-flight magazines available is also ok with quiet some variety of Swiss watches also available in the lower price range. The seats is of the more common recaro slim seats with artificial leather that to my opinion is so so. The cabin temperature was quite high which appears to be normal on Swiss flights for some reason. Best credits to the cabin crew that upon landing welcomed everyone to the ""Royal Kingdom of Sweden"".

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"LX23 JFK-GVA New York to Geneva in February. Flew economy and in spite of the fact that this was a recently refurbished plane (and perhaps even newish) this plane had the most uncomfortable most narrow least leg-room- endowed least padded seats I've encountered. It shouldn't be this way on a transatlantic flight. All domestic flight seats I've had were better than this seating. What's scandalous is the utter contempt this airline has for the passenger: Not only is the seat narrower than you can imagine - I am a 5' 5"" female who weighs just 115 lbs but the armrests between seats only go up about 35 degrees. Meaning even if you have vacant seats next to you you cannot lie down or spread out. I could see everyone else was as shocked as I was on this overnight transatlantic route. I might add that he bulkhead seats which can be prime seats for leg room etc has entirely an entirely fixed armrest that can't be raised at all. The entertainment system felt out of date. The food was just awful. I kept thinking what could they possibly be thinking? The flight felt less than half full and the need for what I imagine was some need to squeeze extra seats onto the floor plan just wasn't apparent eyeing the plane. I would never ever fly Swiss Air again if I could help it. Again this is transatlantic service from New York City and should be the best foot forward.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,BHX-ZRH-SIN on a Fokker 100 followed by an A340-300. Both aircraft's were clearly quite old but very well kept. This was my first time using solely mobile boarding passes on my phone for the entire journey and the check-in and boarding experience was flawless. Check-in desk at Birmingham was kind enough to allow my bag which was almost 2kg over the limit which I was not expecting from a European airline. Zurich airport is definitely a selling point for choosing Swiss stylish easy to navigate and very efficient. Swiss also has probably the best-timed schedules for connecting flights between Europe and Asia. Overall service and hospitality onboard both flights was friendly and attentive almost as good as Asian carriers. Can't say the same about the catering which was rather basic (cold sandwich on a 2 hour full-service international flight is unheard of in Asia no menus offered meal portions intercontinental were on the small side). Upsides were the surprisingly good wine available and the delicious Swiss cheese. The Y seat on the A340 is okay but rather outdated with no in-seat power or foot rest and an annoyingly large IFE box under the window seat. No amenity kits whatsoever on a 12 hour flight but the frequent drinks service was appreciated.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,BOM-ZRH-ORD. A decent product overall. Positives: Flights departed on time and arrived slightly early. New terminal in Mumbai was a pleasure to use and lounge facilities were still under construction so had all C class area in a converted area which was fine and had great selection of food. I found the flat seat good overall didn't like how it sinks all the way to the ground but sill was flat and not angled which makes all the difference. ORD-ZRH were good multi course and offered cheese and dessert. Wines were excellent. Negatives: Cabin service between the two flights very different BOM-ZRH flight leaves early morning and crew serves light one tray snack which is cold then disappears until 1 hour before landing and serves a one-tray breakfast which was abysmal at best. Crew were cold and looked tired. Cabin also showing signs of age with small stains here and there.

I did not like to be delayed for longer than necessary so I had to call a friend to check alternative schedules online while I was there at the transfer desk. Then I struggled to get the Swiss transfer desk to put me on the next flight. To me it was completely unacceptable that Swiss would not put me on the earliest possible connection with another airline instead of having to wait nearly 24 hours to catch the next Swiss flight.",0,Brak oceny,T Nielsen,2014-02-07,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,1,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,13 Dec 2013 LX345 LHR-ZRH. LX154 ZRH-BOM. 3 Jan 2014 LX155 BOM-ZRH ZRH-LHR. Early morning on time flight easy connection in Zurich no more security check. LX345 awful breakfast nice service plane full wheelchair assistance perfectly done. LX154 A330 single seat at back of business. From the start excellent service from all flight personnel pre-flight service was done without fuss or rush. Drinks with nuts and crackers followed by a top notch meal all chosen from Swiss menu. Very comfortable seat which moves to several different positions with ease. Second meal looked good but was still full from lunch.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,OSL-ZRH-BOS in First. I flew OSL-ZRH in Business food just ok service great seating ok. Arrived in Zurich went to the First lounge. Open and clean with good choices of food and drinks. But not stunning in any way. But they had a restaurant there with pretty good options and wine also a big liquor trolley. After some hours me and four more passengers where driven to terminal E for boarding in a Caravelle mini van. Upon boarding I was greeted by the Captain and the Maitre de Cabin and two other very nice FA`s. The cabin feels opulent but not bling like EK. Food was the best I have had in the air wine list good but not the best. Service was very good but I prefer BA. 4/8 in F so we all got window seats. This was a day flight but still I wanted to sleep a couple of hours. They made my bed beside me so I could go to sleep when I felt like it.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,I have flown more than 10 times with Swiss in the past year both intra-European and long haul and have found a reliable product every single time. What strikes me reading some of the other reviews here is how thoughtless some comments are. On a 40-min flight from Luxembourg to Zurich there is no other option than to serve small bottles of water to speed up proceedings. Swiss does not (yet) operate 777 aircraft and if you can't stand that half the space in the long-haul planes caters for business and first class passengers don't book an economy class seat!,0,9,C Francq,2014-01-29,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"LX1254 from ZRH-ARN January 20 2014 in Premium Economy. The aircraft used on this service was an Airbus A320 and I was seated in the last row (36F). Since this is a code-share flight with SAS Scandinavian Airlines and I was booked on a SK-flight number you are normally only offered a middle-seat by Swiss unless you select to sit in the the last couple of rows in the airplane which I did. (Gave me a row on myself). The experience with Swiss on Intra-European routes is by no means anything extraordinary. The comfort of the seats are resonably ok but basically the same type of relatively uncomfortable Recaro seats you will find on the other Star Alliance Partners within Europe (Austrian Lufthansa). The Airbus A320-series of Swiss have an in-flight entertainment system with the first generation of screens sliding down from the overhead bins. What is shown on the screens are however so so. Even in economy you are offered free drinks and a snack. On this flight we were offered a ""Tasteful Italian Pizza Slide"". Exactly the same pizza slide has been offered for the last three years while I have regularly been travelling on this specific route. I can tell you that the pizza slide is indeed not especially tasteful! To summaries really nothing to complain about but not a special experience.",0,5,Gustafsson Magnus,2014-01-21,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,3,3,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flew from New York to Greece through Geneva and returned through Zurich. Half the plane caters to business class. If you're flying economy you're out of luck. The economy class passengers are packed like sardines. No leg room and very tight seats. I'm a small person and I was very uncomfortable. I can't imagine how a larger frame person will be. I'm told that Airbus has nothing to do with the number of seats in a plane. Seats are installed based on the airline requests. An additional issue: I enrolled to the Star Alliance award program through United and Swiss would not credit the missing miles because the trip was already complete when I enrolled but their website does not indicate this. If I recommend Swiss is for the fair last minute booking price and no delays.,0,3,Gioles Eugenia,2014-01-14,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,3,3,Swiss International Air Lines

The airline wrote stating ""you can't order a special meal as we only serve snacks no meals on short flights within Europe."" I was flying business so I was surprised to get such an answer. I provided the airline with my booking number when I contacted them so they saw my booking details.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Travelling from Luxembourg you will first have to deal with the lack of a proper drop-off zone. This actually makes online check-in a bit useless. The short flight to Zurich is not very pleasant as I really don't like to be flown on those Avro planes. Service is ok for such a short flight even though there was a lack of standards like napkin with the drink or even a cup with the water bottle. They don't serve snacks in economy on a 40 min flight. Unusual for somebody used to the local carriers excellent service. Zurich airport is fantastic! Quiet well organised and nice to look at. The long haul flight to MIA was of good standard. IFE is slow and a bit old fashioned. Service and food was ok for a 10 hours flight. The two girls on our side of the plane were very friendly courteous and helpful. I have to point out the impeccable state of the restrooms throughout the flight! Arrival in MIA was hassle free as we were the only international flight arriving at that time (6pm) and all immigration officers were there only for Swiss. Return from LAX also no drop-off zone for baggage again pre- checked-in online. Treated ourselves to a paying upgrade into business class. The seats are nice and good. Not my favourite though. The food concept is ok and especially the service routine for breakfast was confusing to me: No information about the options on the menu card which makes it even harder to pick a choice from the service cart and it all was on demand. Espresso service is great! All of the cabin crew were really nice caring and friendly. The downturn was the 'maitre de cabine' who was rushing down the aisle with her service cart and lacked proper service enthusiasm and should have taken her team as role models. IFE again too complicated for me compared to LH and EY. Short hop to Luxembourg again uneventful but on an Avro-liner.,0,8,A Kellner,2014-01-08,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,4,4,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,LX 179 SIN-ZRH on 16 December 2013. First flight on Swiss - we were a family flying business class to London via Zurich. We were very underwhelmed by the experience. The headrests weren't clean food and service were average and the basins in the business class toilets didn't work for the entire 14 hour flight - it felt more like premium economy. Compared to other business class services that we had experienced this was at the low end. One redeeming feature - plane was on time and we made our connection to London - again on Swiss. The connecting Swiss flight to London was also business class and the service and food were much improved - and the toilet basins worked.,0,3,G Hyde,2013-12-31,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,2,N/A,3,2,Swiss International Air Lines

Very young inexperienced and simply untrained staff (particularly in economy on JNB-ZRH route) sometimes poor in English and surprisingly not able to speak neither German nor French.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,We can certainly not expect that Swiss reaches the same level as the ex. Swissair! For a short range flight no problem because the crew are fantastic the planes starts and arrives on time the security feeling on board is very good but for long haul flights it's a complete different story. I travelled back from the USA from LAX to ZRH with one of their A340s and the cabin configuration seat comfort and temperatures on board were simply unacceptable for an 11 hours flight. The seats are good enough if you travel between two children but if you are between two male adults you will spend 11 hours without moving a finger.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,LX181 BKK-ZRH 17/18 December C Class. No waiting at the dedicated business check-in quick courteous service with informative advice on fast track and lounge location. In practice local immigration staff directed us through the crew/diplomatic fast track which had us airside within 15 minutes from disembarking the taxi. Swiss badly let down by the standards at the Thai Royal Orchid lounge at D Concourse. Amongst other matters there are no calls in this lounge which resulted in a wait at the gate before priority boarding of premium cabins. The standard set at check-in was more than matched once onboard with a keen energetic and engaging cabin staff we were addressed by name throughout and regularly questioned if there was anything further we could be assisted with. Pre take-off drinks - champagne juice or water - on time push back full dinner service when airborne (entree choice of three mains - the steak was one of the best cooked and most flavoursome enjoyed aloft - cheese and dessert complemented by a choice of two white wines (Swiss or NZ) and two reds (Australian and French) and a good nights sleep on the flat bed.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,25 November Zurich ZRH-Berlin TXL LX970 / 29 November Berlin TXL-Zurich ZRH LX971. The outbound flight arrived on time seat comfort was very good and there was a very frendly and competent cabin crew at work. The return flight arrived about 25 minutes late (rush hour at TXL) but the standards of comfort and cabin crew were equally good. But the overall feeling was not very inviting and quite annoying because both flights (Airbus A321) were more or less full. There were lots of business travellers with huge carry on luggage lots of heavy jackets because of winter time and yes boarding and deboarding an Airbus A321 through only one door takes a long time. But I am not going to blame Swiss for that elsewhere I would have had the same experience. I paid EUR 180 for the ticket which is a good fare from my point of view. I will definitely consider Swiss again. Zurich airport is very efficient and passenger friendly while it is good that Berlin TXL is going to be replaced.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"ZRH-PVG (Shanghai) on an A343 fully booked in the ""upper classes"" (maybe as well in economy but I could not verify). Plane clean and well maintained ""full flat seats"" but my aisle seat was open in the very front thus the feet could easily slip to the right and collide with the people moving in the aisle. Window seats do not have this risk. Departure with a minimal delay arrival about 20 minutes late due to ""avoiding Russian airspace"" thus taking the Southern route over Turkmenistan Kazakstan and entering Chinese airspace West of Urumqi - this is altogether a flight time of one additional hour. Meal service consisted of a late lunch and an early breakfast almost at sunrise over Central China - both with good choices good quality - just good European business class standard but also taking Asian tastes into consideration (two of the four meal choices can be called Asian dishes). Beverage selection ok no ""high class wines"" - one Swiss white and red each plus three additional European varieties. The result is probably similar to my choices if someone would ask me to suggest five reasonable wines giving me a strict budget plus the must of choosing two Swiss ones. Thus I do not complain but enthusiasm sounds different AVOD is not my topic - I just follow the airshow read dine and take a nap.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,This was my second Swiss Business-class experience long-haul and intra-Europe in four years and the improvements in all facets were both subtle and noticeable. Their resumption of SIN services appears to be paying off with excellent loads both ways (previous trip was ex-HKG). Outwards SIN-ZRH LX179 was on the oldest A340 (HB-JMA) but you would not have known it from the immaculate cabin. Cabin crew an absolute delight with a range of ages and genders and every one with whom I interacted was cheerful and charming the friendly teamwork was a joy to observe. The addition of a seat controls briefing card’to the seat-pocket contents was a welcome and helpful addition to the reconfigured A340. Choose an outboard single seat if travelling alone I had 9K on the LX179 and 11K on the return LX178 and enjoyed a decent 5hrs snooze on the former and almost 8hrs solid sleep on the latter. In Europe the ZRH-TXL (and later return) sectors demonstrated why Swiss has been awarded Best European Business Airline. Crew interaction details (jackets lockers water bottles reading materials chocolates) and short- sector catering were all happy experiences. The return LX178 ZRH-SIN crew didn't quite make par with their 179 counterparts a fortnight earlier but their colleagues had set a very high bar. Both food and wine were very good indeed. Transfers at ZRH were flawless and the ‘worlds longest attended bar’above the J and F lounges is worth adjusting a connecting flight to allow an hour or two extra enjoyment.,0,10,Matthew Tesch,2013-11-05,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,ZRH-HKG-ZRH round-trip in space of a week with ageing A343 in Economy Class. Cabin service lacks warmth and smile on both legs. Very professional and efficient cabin service but no feeling of sincerity coming through. Y-class food of good standard nothing special though despite the fact that Swiss prides itself in using GateGourmet as opposed to LSG. IFE system definitely long out of date with very basic inflight tracking capability and animation radio channel selection also poor. Worst of all on this flight was the Y-class seat itself. Leg-room actually decent but the softness of the seat is poor. It is very hard to sit on and on a 12 hr flight is VERY uncomfortable overall compared to other Y-class comfort at other carriers. Cabin temperature on overnight flight much too cold.,0,6,P Schuster,2013-10-23,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,2,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,GVA-JFK via ZRH. The A330-300 with their new business class seat and screen are much appreciated the service is very good the meal could have been slightly better however they paid attention to the requests and constantly filled up glasses and the cherry on the cake: I mentioned that I liked the Swiss chocolate bars - the ones they hand out in for coffee or during short flights - at the end the Maitre de Cabin brought me a small nicely handwrapped bag with around 7 bars inside!

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Cairo - Zurich - London Heathrow. CAI-ZRH check in staff at CAI friendly and helpful. Aircraft was A340 is ageing but well maintained. Cabin crew attentive and friendly. They love to smile whenever making eye contact with passengers. Food well presented and delicious. They even provide blankets and pillows during this day flight how thoughtful. ZRH-LHR everything good. SWISS chocolate at the end of the flight is a nice touch.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,HKG-ZRH Business. The most disorganised meal service I've ever seen. The new configuration must make it difficult for crew however repeatedly wandering around looking for non-existent passengers in the middle of a meal service was of concern. Three rows from the front of business and 1 hr 20 mins after they started serving the meal we still didn't have a food an entree a bread roll or a drink! Swiss used to be my favourite Euro airline from Asia however standards service inedible food and the new cabin sadly make Swiss a very low choice of mine now.,0,6,P Anda,2013-10-13,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,2,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"I flew from Zurich to Stockholm on Monday 30th Sept and back to Zurich on Friday 4th October. This was not the first time I was flying to Stockholm (6 other times in the last 3 months) and I have always had the same so-called ""Bruschetta"" as meal. Disgusting. The cheese is indigestible and they do not offer you any other option. I wonder how a such reputable airline company is not able to vary its offer.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flight SIN-ZRH followed by ZRH-AMS. If you are used to be pampered by Asian (full-frill not budget airlines) and Middle Eastern airlines you will feel the difference immediately. Cabin staff were efficient but they lack warmth when serving or dealing with passengers. Planes were not exactly new a bit worn out. Inflight entertainment seemed like those in the early-2000.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"SIN-ZRH on A340 first class. Do not understand why Swiss still has the old first cabin on their longest haul A340 - not up to competition. That said seat with ottoman still comfy. IFE not up to first class - screen to small - selection limited (especially if you just got of a SQ flight). Cabin staff always a delight - always the right level of personal interaction attentive nothing is too much trouble. I prefer the ""senior"" crew LX uses for first cabin - biggest asset LX has.

Seats 9A-9C (in the middle of windows here so little view). I really enjoyed the near-first class service standards of SWISS. The cabin attendants service and food were excellent. The ""new"" SWISS business class seats are very firm (too firm) and although they do recline to a ""flat bed"" they are not 100% parallel to the floor they DO slant slightly forward.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flew in July and August on various Swiss flights - mostly in business. LAX-ZRH and ZRH-SIN were both fantastic on A340. The flat bed is 2 metres long as very comfortable when flat and in seating position. Staff were very good and nothing was too much trouble. It would be helpful if there were 2 pillows per person as when flat the 1 small pillow isn't sufficient to get comfortable enough. not a problem when flight isn't full but when it is none spare. Also flew GVA - Athens and Athens - Zurich in business. Typical short haul flights but very comfortable in business and excellent food and service. Lounges also great in LA Geneva Zurich and Athens.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,In the last year I have travelled SWISS about half a dozen times of which over 50% of these experiences have led to severe delay cancellation or worse. I have been re-routed to Zurich from Geneva due to a cancelled flight put in a hotel and flown the next morning. I have been driven across London from London City to Heathrow due to a cancelled flight arriving in my destination many hours after I was meant to. Tuesday (23 July) we had engine trouble mid-air on a flight from Geneva to London City and I was re-routed to Paris CDG put in a hotel and flown the next morning. The handling of the situation on Tuesday by the ground handling agent was chaotic with only 2 staff on duty to manage 100 passengers. It took several hours to resolve. Following this incident on the return leg the SWISS passenger system claimed I hadn't taken my outward leg so ground handlers tried to remove me from the return flight. 45 minutes to resolve. In the end the flight on 28th July (1935 LCY-GVA) was also cancelled.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flew Singapore to Venice and Rome to Singapore all via Zurich by Swiss International after a lapse of 6 years. On first look the new fully flat Business class seats (5D & 5G) were too small and narrow and there is a serious lack of storage spaces. Lowered seat to the lowest possible level but did not sleep well as any food trolley movement or turbulence could be clearly felt since bed was close to the floor. So on the return journey I lowered the bed close to but NOT to the lowest level and slept much better. Service was generally good although food variety and quality cannot be compared to SQ Biz class. But then we got the Swiss Biz class tickets during their promo period and thus we are not complaining.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Zurich-Singapore. A long 14 hour flight so during those long hours I expected only the best service. I arrived to my seat and realized I did not have a TV in-front of me. Not only that but my seat was broken. It would move as I leaned back and fourth. My TV was located on the seat to my right which meant for those 14 hours I had to lean to the side while watching a movie. I called the flight attendant over before take off and showed her the problems and asked what can be done. She said there was nothing wrong with the location of my TV and would not look at my broken seat. She just walked off and told me she would be back soon - never came back. When we first got on the plane there was no air con for at least 40 minutes. Everyone was using magazines to cool themselves down. I suggest in the future to not choose this airline.

The seat is very comfortable with a completely 180 degree recline and up to 2 m length. Shortly after take-off I was offered a 3 course meal with caviar scallops salmon and chicken. Stags Leap Artemis was the best choice of wine on the list along with the Santa Barbara Chardonnay. Went to sleep after the meal and slept for almost 3 hours.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,JFK-ZRH on A330. We arrived at ZRH airport 50 min ahead of time which was great. The food was not good unfortunately. The seats were okay and the entertainment system much better than A340. We had two ladies serving us during the flight. Both of them seemed to be having a bad day: no smiling at all and short unfriendly comments to guests. The staff were obviously very stressed which made me feel uncomfortable.,0,3,P Delafontaine,2013-06-19,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,2,3,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,ZRH-LAX on A340. The cabin was clean but not much space. We arrived on time LAX. The service was okay two friendly and funny flight attendants (men).

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flight from ZRH to NCE.

Cabin worn out and inflight entertainment very old with analog like screens. ZRH-MAD-ZRH on newer A320 slightly more comfortable and nicer leather seats. ZRH airport is nice and transfer was easy and straightforward. Would not fly them again.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Long haul on Swiss is certainly different than flights within Europe. Flew ZRH-BKK-ZRH and all I can say is that service is average. A340 rather old however kept clean. Service on board also average at best just one or two flight attendants smiling the rest just doing their job. Food ok with limited availability. Especially on the routes to Asia Swiss has to improve significantly if they want to compete with ME-carriers and such as SQ CX TG and nowadays GA. AVOD with limited selection and working with problems on the outbound leg.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,SIN-ZRH in economy. A343 was kept in a very clean and good condition despite being old. Cabin was quiet during flight and the seat was comfortable. Flight was very smooth. Only gripe was the cramped leg space due to the metal IFE box below the seat in front. The SWISS.com website didn't reflect correctly which seats had those nasty metal boxes. The metal box occupies about half of your leg space. Food was not to my taste unfortunately. On both legs (SIN-ZRH-SIN) I couldn't use the AVOD screen properly. Once the person in front reclines fully the screen is very dim even at maximum brightness. No matter how I titled the screen I couldn't watch the movies properly. The IFE system hung 2x on me. Crew was attentive on the SIN-ZRH but not the other way round. Pressed the call-for- attendant button 3 times on 2 occasions and no flight attendant came by. I would say if you want a smooth and quiet flight without much frills go for it. The SWISS chocolates handed out at the end of each flight were tasty though.,0,7,J Lim,2013-06-09,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,3,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,CDG-ZRH-CAI return. Seat quite comfortable specially the ZRH-CAI leg. Airbus 340 is 2x4x2. What was disappointing was the food no choice on the long haul with a lack of French speaking staff on board. Switzerland is at least a bilingual country and announcements should be done at least in the 2 languages (German and French) plus English. Another bad point is the transfers in Zurich airport. Rail shuttle and miles to walk. Nevertheless the ratio price service was good.,0,7,J Costi,2013-06-09,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,3,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Manchester via Zurich to Singapore. Leg room on each of the Manchester Zurich flights was quite good but both long haul flights to and from Singapore were very cramped.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,ZRH-CDG flight CDG-ZRH business trip in Economy - both flights on time and web check-in worked perfectly and saved a lot of time as travelled only with hand luggage. Both flights uneventful and short (50min). First Outbound flight nearly full but received a good service from the SWISS staff. Coffee and croissant ok but nothing special. Flight back to Zurich a (very) small sandwich was served and (complimentary) alcohol was served (Beer wine etc)! Great little chocolates as always. Seats good - but if you have the possibility to have a seat within a empty row go for it as comfort is substantially better. No IFE but necessary as short flight.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,DXB-ZRH-BCN. I am a frequent flyer and always use this airline within Europe. However yesterdays long-haul experience made me decide to never fly Swiss again. After appalling management from Dubai offices staff who has been unable to manage correctly a change of date for my return flight (outbound flight had been made in January) I was finally booked on the right day for a EUR 250 change fee. This has been a very bad flight: chaotic check-in made by rude ground-staff boarding was made in the same atmosphere. Sets were narrow on-board service nearly non-existent no interaction with cabin crew. Food was awful and poor. Temperature was cold with no personal air system. Transfer at Zurich was awful. However ZRH-BCN flight was excellent. If Swiss provides a good service within Europe transatlantic and intercontinental flights are overall a very bad product.

Pilot kept us informed during flight even when we were put on hold before landing in ZRH. Got a nice croissant as well as juice and a cup of coffee. Return flight was full again but at the boarding gate agent forced us to give one of our handbag up to be checked in. Agent was rude and was not polite at all. Once on board I asked the purser to get our bag as there was plenty of room in the bins. She approved to take our bag into the cabin. It fitted easily into the bin.

The lounge in Zurich E terminal is lousy and cramped. The seating onboard is too narrow for me. Have been used to better food. Overall the Gulf airlines give you a better C-Class experience. First Class is a whole different story. Great seating and bedding. Personal transfer in Zurich between the two terminals and wonderful lounge. Definitely the best in the airline industry.

Nice meal working entertainment system with consol for kids. The system got frozen they had to restart it two times but at the end we were able to watch the movies dedicated for first class too.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,A340 from Los Angeles to Zurich and return. Major complaint we have is that in economy class the video screens were difficult to see when the passengers in front of us reclined their seats. The screen doesn't tilt enough to compensate for the angle change created by reclining seats. We were unable to watch movies due to poor visibility. The video system seemed old and mine froze on me a couple of times and had to be rebooted.

A small and tasty hot meal was served with beverages. The crew was polite and efficient. The plane was on time and the luggage appeared fairly promptly (albeit a little damp on the outside from having stood in the open during a connection at Geneva while it was raining).

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,CDG-ZRH-LAX return. Economy. Legs on A320 were fine for such short flights: thin seats which leave surprisingly good legroom a bit of decent food and nice FA. A340 very ageing with sad brownish colours. Food was average and not very plentiful though I could get a true gin tonic. Most FAs were nice and some even very smiling or a bit funny. IFE screens surprisingly large for Y class with good selection and many languages yet unfortunately on both legs not working very well. Long delay on first flight no apologies and not any word from the captain (but the FAs tried their best to manage the situation). ZRH airport is spotless.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Very unpleasant experience with Swiss on a flight from Rome to Kiev stepping over in Zurich: First flight was very late for the fog in Rome (no complains on that) but the assistance of Swiss personnel was terrible: the lady didn't have a monitor and was asking by phone other flight possibilities. On the flight to Zurich I had to insist with the hostess to check the connection and give me assistance to arrive quickly to the gate for the flight to Kiev. Arriving in Zurich with very tight connection nobody assisted me and I had to run end to end in the Zurich airport.

FA's were friendly and restrooms were clean. I think it has been over 20 years since I have had real silverware in Economy but Swiss provided it on both flights. Wine cheese and chocolate were great.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flew from Johannesburg to Zurich on A340. Didn't have pyjamas in my size on board. The cabin is very dated when compared to the new Swiss First on A330. The seat was very uncomfortable fully reclined as it is not completely flat (the backrest still extended slightly outwards and the mattress cover they provide is not thick enough to iron out all irregularities). When I ordered a coffee in the morning I had to remind flight attendant again ca. 10 minutes later. The cabin was full and the one small bathroom was crowded in the morning with people changing again. I would not recommend the First class product on A340. I also wish the Swiss crew would loosen up a bit more. They come across as very uptight when compared to the Lufthansa crew who often seem happy to serve you.,0,5,U Günther,2013-04-16,no,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,4,N/A,3,3,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,LCY to ZRH April 2013 Business Class. Good service in the air unfortunately let down by the policy of allocating both A and B seats in business class in a 2-3 configuration. Their competitor on this route only allocates either or in the same scenario. On this flight there were 8 rows of business class which equals a capacity of 32 seats. There were only 8 passengers so why Swiss insisted on seating solo passengers right next to each other in the AB seats and leaving so many rows free is a mystery.,0,5,D Ellis,2013-04-16,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,4,3,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Friday 15th March Zurich to Shanghai Pudong in Business Class. A family with a child (supposed to stay on the parent's lap but of course it did not stay there) kept the entire Business Section awake because of the child's loud voice. Cabin crew went out of their way to ignore the problem. Even discounting the anti-social behaviour: when will airlines learn how to do the maths? Introduce child-free sections and enforce it! Then the seats. Extremely hard like sleeping on a bunk. To top it off the captain had announced a quiet flight (weather wise) but over half of the time we experienced turbulence. While the latter is of course not due to the airline it still counts as the worst flight of my life. I will avoid Swiss Business long haul until they have one or two problems sorted out.,0,4,Leo Schikhof,2013-04-14,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,3,N/A,3,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,CDG-ZRH-ATH return. Very disappointing use of business class due to wishing to have large seats the 3-3 combination but airline had chosen to block the middle seat with a completely hard table that is not removable this gives the impression that the seat is even smaller than in economy as there is no way of raising the arm rest to expand over into the middle seat - as a large person the idea of having extra space is why I paid for business. Staff did their best to try to move me which ended up by moving economy passengers around and putting me in economy with a free seat next to me. A solution but not nice when you are expecting a business class experience. Staff were trying to make up for this by being particularly attentive but bear this in mind if you wish to have more space. It would have been cheaper for me to pay for 2 seats in economy. If I were a smaller/average size person it might have been a good experience as food was nice and service was great - but bad seats let them down. On the return journey I had only 10 mins to transfer planes due to the late takeoff and this was a bit stressful.,0,6,D Ellender,2013-04-11,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,4,N/A,5,3,Swiss International Air Lines

Plane seemed to be new in very good shape clean and with nice brown colors. Check in very quick and efficient I had seat no. 28 B with limited recline due to a metal box behind. Space between seats small as in other airlines (I’m 6.4’ tall) but comfortable. Good VOD with a nice screen. The crew were very attentive and discreet spoke German English Italian and French. Served food wasn't very tasty (maybe because it was an US-Outbound fly and the food wasn't prepared by Swiss) but sufficient. They serve real cutlery even in Economy not plastic as the other airlines do. I travel a lot between North America and Europe. It was the first time I tried Swiss on this route and I'm sure I will try to fly them again in future.

The business class cabin had a distinct ""Premium Economy"" feel to it it simply does not compare to other experiences I've had on British Airways Virgin Upper Class or Cathay Pacific. The flatbed was the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced travelling business class. The bed was narrow very hard the pillow miserably thin and the blanket straight out of economy. I distinctly recall lying awake angry thinking this is not a business class bed. I felt like I had slept on a park bench for the night.

I had 23D which offers extra legroom but the seat is very narrow due to the remote being on the side taking about 1 inch from the seat width. Tray was broken and did not come out. Several panels were loose as well. Remote for the entertainment system was worn out and I needed 10 or more tries to get to the movie I wanted. Flight attendants were unfriendly they were hardly visible. When I asked for a Coke I was told had to come to the galley in the back to pick it up. Food was very bad. Arrival delay also 45 minutes.

Good working personal entertainment system with a wide range of movies etc. Warm wet towels before landing. We boarded long haul flight on time but were still delayed due to loading the aircraft. In air one hour behind schedule. Good information from cockpit  landed almost an hour after scheduled time so we only had 25 min in between the two flights but managed it even though arrival and next departure was on different terminals. Flight number 2 also nice experience. Friendly crew offered sandwiches and drinks. Impressed that they managed to reload all our luggage within so short time but everything golf bags and suitcases came as it should on arrival in Copenhagen. Will absolutely fly them again.",0,8,C Wadstrom,2013-03-01,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,5,5,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flight from Zurich to Newark on a brand new Airbus A330. Seats comfortable great service with very attentive and nice flight attendants.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,MAD-ZRH-BUD. Departed late from Madrid but we were able to make the connection at Zurich and the crew apologized many times for the delay.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,MCT-ZRH-FRA on 30 Jan 13. Swiss lounge in Muscat shabby! On board experience excellent: Very attentive and friendly staff best food and wine quality I have had on a plane for a very long time beds comfortable with cosy linen sheet and pillow covers. Transfer in Zurich swift and again very friendly with private minibus pick-up from plane accelerated immigration and direct transfer to the 1st class lounge which was small but excellent.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,From Moscow DME to Zürich. Check-in was time consuming. Waiting time was 50 minutes to board an Airbus A321. Seats were not good first row behind the business class plane fully booked no space in the overhead compartments so the space was even further reduced. Cabin crew passive and not overly helpful. Flight was on time plane not the latest but in an acceptable condition.,0,2,T Dahlke,2013-02-18,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,3,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,LHR-SFO. All flights almost on time which is quite remarkable considering the poor weather conditions. Food and beverage service above average for economy. Staff were continuously coming through cabin with water and if you wanted something a little stronger you could head to the galley where a snack bar was set up and drinks would be dispensed quite freely. Seats are as comfortable as they're ever going to be in economy leg room not great but once again this economy so can't complain. My only gripe would be that the inflight entertainment is a bit antiquated not touch screen on the A340 and has a fiddly little remote in the arm rest with a mind of its own. Also the screen quality is brilliant and the headphones awful. All in all a good first impression and will definitely fly Swiss again.,0,8,Andrew Stewart,2013-02-15,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,5,5,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,MAD-ZRH-GRU-ZRH-MAD. And GRU-SCL-GRU codeshare with TAM. In MAD fast and efficient check-in. Short hops MAD-ZRH-MAD in 320 clean aircraft's and quite comfortable seats. Snacks served not up to Swiss standards but good choice of drinks. Transit in ZRH very easy and nice. ZRH is a good airport for transferring with many shops and restaurants although a bit pricey. Long haul legs in a bit dated but well kept 340s. Dinner on both flights was tasty but portions too small. Breakfast like in most flights nowadays a big let down. A box with cold stale bread croissant and juice and yoghurt with hot drinks. Seats were comfortable but a bit cramped especially if you are in the window but still managed a few hours sleep. PTV working well but didn't use it much. All flights on time. All in all a good experience and would fly them again.,0,7,D Borillo,2013-02-14,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,3,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,MAN-ZRH-BEG flight from Manchester boarded on time however after door was closed told there was a 40 delaye. This delay turned into 1hr 45 minutes and all we were provided with was water and it was not until after much customer protest was the toilets allowed to be used. Into Zurich an hour late and was informed connecting flight had waited. Again got on board and doors were closed and again informed there would be a delay due to Zurich not giving clearance. We sat on plane 3 hours again with only water and a bar of chocolate to be then informed Swiss had cancelled the flight due to operational reasons. As we queued at immigration we noticed our plane was now being used for a flight to Athens! We got put up in the Hilton which was nice enough but would of preferred to be at my destination.,0,4,S Farrell,2013-02-14,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,3,3,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,FRA-ZRH-JNB and return. Short and normal flight from Frankfurt to Zurich. Late departure flight from Zurich to Johannesburg in A340-300. Seat 5K. Rather disappointed because small space only. Sitting at window - shoulder is touching the window wall all the time. Hard seat medium selection in IFE. Small but good dinner. Flight attendants not very friendly except the purser. On the way back same seat in row 7 with same problems. Dinner and wine again tasteful and good inflight attendants.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,PEK-ZRH on A343. Was probably the best long-haul flight I've experienced. Everything was just perfect. Fortunately that day I flew the load factor was incredibly low so there was a lot of room for all passengers. AVOD is oldish but still can make a good service.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,MAD-ZHR-MAN return. Excellent on-time flights all round with charming and courteous FAs and very good in- flight catering. Smooth check-ins and transfers at Zurich - it's a very easy airport to negotiate.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Excellent flight from LHR to JFK via Geneva. Despite leaving London late we were met in Geneva and rushed to the plane where flight attendants appeared to be expecting us. Clean and new Airbus 320 aircraft with good flight entertainment which kept the kids quiet. Food not bad although kids offering unappetising. Courteous and friendly staff couldn't fault them. Flight came out cheapest on Skyscanner so for the minor inconvenience of going via Geneva offered very good value for a family of four. Only downside was unable to confirm flights on website very frustrating but didn't seem to matter at check-in. Would recommend this airline.,0,9,K Coopey,2013-01-31,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,5,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Zurich to London. Very disappointed with Swiss Air Check-in Staff. Wheelchair requested prior to flight yet not organised. Arrived 1.5hours early. On crutches had to move around and speak to five different check-in staff. Officious ticketing officer issued boarding pass for a seat in the third back row of the plane though doctors letter stipulated that extra legroom was required. Humiliating and stressful. No compassion or consideration shown.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,MCR to Zurich to Newark in business. Third time I have flown them and was impressed. Hot breakfast on the Manchester - Zurich route was pretty good. No TV though which would have been nice though the flight is short. Food was the best I have had on a flight. Nice wines too. Decent entertainment package. Lie flat seat are good though they are a bit hard. Attendants are good not too imposing. Doesn't seem though to be enough bathrooms on the plane which I think it was an A330.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flew Zurich to Brussels and back in Economy - however probably the most uneconomic flight ever: CHF 1600 (EUR 1250) for a semi-flex return. No more wifi in Zurich's Star-gold lounge from 01 January 2013 unless you have a qualifying mobile phone number (e.g +41).

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS) to Zurich Kloten (ZRH) on Airbus A320. Plane was fairly new seats were okay. Aircraft departed on time and landed ahead of schedule. Great service on board with good inflight entertainment for a European flight (on overhead screens) very good cabin service (with sandwich drinks and chocolate) and very friendly crew. SWISS has definitely got a good offer on medium-haul flights and service on board and on the ground are very good.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flew ZRH-JFK on an A330. Very relaxing colors with light wood panelling. Great service and crew with excellent language skills. Food and wines were very also excellent and with a local flair promoting different regions of Switzerland. Once the seat is turned into a bed full flat with a real duvet and a normal size pillow you are almost like in a normal bed. Entertainment also quite good with a nice choice of movies and a large fixed screen. The movable half partition gives you privacy without the feeling of being claustrophobic. An excellent product for a European airline. I would definitely recommend them.,0,10,Ender Ozsezen,2013-01-09,yes,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Business class on A340 from Tokyo to Zurich and despite great expectations I was disappointed. ANA do the check in at Narita and they were very pleasant. Staff on board were polite but food was non-memorable the one meal for the 12-hour flight was far too small with nothing but a light snack shortly before landing in Zurich. Movie selection was quite extensive. Seat was very upright and hard for sitting and my type of seat along the wall was probably the worst type of seat. It was claustrophobic as the curved wall encroached upon my space both when sitting or lying down. Seat is uncomfortably narrow for both sitting and trying to sleep. Being a wide shouldered man I could not really sleep on my back between the armrests. You legs are stuck in a tunnel or box making it difficult to get in and out of the seat when it is reclined. I am not excited about using Swiss again but if I did I would try to get a seat in the centre of the plane.,0,6,M Sidloski,2013-01-09,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,4,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,ZRH-IST on A320. In business the middle seat is kept empty but doesn't have a tray as on the 321. Plane was tidy and clean but seats are starting to show their age. Not much leg room especially in the first rows. Service was very friendly and efficient and the purser was great. Usually young flight attendants are trained on this flight and on a full flight when left alone in business class it can be a disaster at times but luckily it was not the case on this flight. For a short European flight food is not with local Swiss specialities (with portions getting smaller and smaller) and a nice selection of wines but still far below the competition. Good selection of newspapers and magazines.,0,8,Ender Ozsezen,2013-01-09,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,3,N/A,5,3,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Overall I was happy with this airline. I was not however altogether too pleased with their online check-in system. Since I was flying Swiss through United I was unable to check-in online 24 hours before. I called the company and they told me it would not be possible. The unavailability of online check-in led to problems on the flight namely many passengers being unhappy with their seat assignments. I was asked twice to switch seats. I also overheard 3 other passengers asking other passengers to change seats. They were also very adamant about the weight of carry-on baggage being under 8 pounds. I felt this rule somewhat arbitrary but was happy to comply. Many passengers in line ahead and behind me had to pay the $100.00 fee to check their bags.,0,4,C Smith,2013-01-09,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,4,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,BCN-ZRH-DXB January 3rd. BCN-ZRH departed and landed on time good and efficient service even though the breakfast croissant was quite dry. Equipment: A321 Economy Class is more comfortable than the average on such flights. Short connection time (1 hour) however the transfer went perfectly due to a perfect organization at Zürich Airport. Efficient and cheerful ground staff. ZRH-DXB: departed and landed on time cabin crew polite and efficient good on-board entertainment despite of a reduced choice of movies. Equipment: A330-300 seats in Economy are tiny and dreadful. Food was good but insufficient. At least Maître de Cabine kindly served me an extra main course and a snack before landing (in addition to the traditional Ice Cream) as I was literally starving. Luggage came on time at destination despite of the very short connection time. Good product for a long-haul flight operated by a European airline.,0,7,M Noreisch,2013-01-07,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,3,N/A,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flight 257 TLV to ZRH codeshare with El Al 8853. Aircraft used was an Airbus A330-300. Economy seats were comfortable and clean. Personal inflight entertainment system was easy to use and loaded with content. I cannot comment on the food quality as I did not partake (more tired than anything else on that flight) but the chocolates they distributed before landing was superb. Flight attendants were friendly and easy to approach.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,We flew CPH-ZRH-EWR on Christmas Day. Flight attendants were cheerful and efficient which was great considering every seat was taken and there were huge amounts of young restless children on board. The seats on the A330 aircraft are horrible but at least the service and food were fine. My entertainment module was not functioning and it took me some perseverance to get someone to reboot it but finally it worked. They flew on time for both legs of the trip. This is a decent airline and I would use them again. The Zurich airport is a great place to kill a couple hours during a layover.,0,8,M Scanlon,2013-01-03,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,4,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,I read some poor reviews prior to my flight 19.12.12 and was worried about travelling with 3 young children. However on the 12 hour flight LX038 from Zurich to San Francisco our family was looked after really well. The cabin crew were polite and attentive checking on us to make sure we were ok from time to time. The plane was fairly new clean the food was ok and the entertainment (though I rarely get to view) was good.

I slept for 5 hours which I've never been able to do before on a flight! Short stay in comfortable Swiss Business Class lounge in beautiful Zurich airport. Connection to Brussels on time on A320 and again service and food offering above average for very short flight with attentive and pleasant FA's.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Munich-Zurich on an AVROLINER with 2x3 configuration euro standard of leaving the middle seat empty. Aircraft very clean and comfortable for the 45 minutes flight. A gourmet sandwich with parma ham and Swiss cheese plus choice of alcoholic drinks and chocolate dessert and coffee. Crew polite and attentive but rushed service due to the short length of flight and stormy weather and turbulence. Zurich-Berlin Tegel on an A320 3x3 with the middle seat empty not a fan of this euro-configuration for business. Flight delayed almost an hour in Zurich due to severe storm and airport congestion. For the 1.10 hrs flight a full dinner was served in spite of the heavy rain and turbulence with fresh breads foie-gras and sauerkraut Swiss cheeses and a fruits-tart for dessert. Service was friendly by young flight attendant. Arrived Tegel in late evening with airport almost empty. Baggage was one of the first due to Priority tags.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,JNB-ZRH-LHR in Business. First stage a very mixed bag. The new long-haul business seat is a minor miracle in that with a small gap between the rows one gets a lot of personal space (especially in the single seats by the windows). Both dinner and breakfast were excellent and the service attentive. On the negative side the pillow and blanket are paltry and the entertainment system antiquated. Short hop to London ok but nothing special.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Had the opportunity to try out the new Business Class product on LX due to the Thanksgiving week premium fare sale EWR-ZRH A340-300 on the way out A330-300 on the way back. Seats were roomy for C with only 4 or 5 across (depending on row) made for lots of living and storage space. My only complaint was how low to the ground the seats were in bed mode - you felt every single bump. That said it did an excellent job providing privacy and blocking out any ambient light. Service was highly professional and pleasant flight attendants where everything from meal service to mid-flight beverage requests was quickly responded to with a smile. Passengers were addressed by name and as far as I could tell every member of staff spoke English in addition to Schweizerdeutsch (and a few French as well). I highly recommend trying the Swiss speciality entree for me it did not disappoint. IFE was a mixed bag. While both aircraft type feature AVOD the A340's system appears to be an older generation - clunky interface long load times and the system froze on me (necessitating a reset) twice. The A330 has a newer system better interface and a larger screen although with the same limited selection as on the outbound flight. Despite wishing the seat's bed mode was slightly higher and a more extensive/ newer IFE system I had an overall excellent experience with the best sleep I've ever had on an airplane.,0,9,Thom Furey,2012-12-19,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flight on an A340 from PEK to ZRH. Seats are really starting to show their age now especially when compared to the new version existing in the A330's. Otherwise cabin clean and tidy. Service was very personalized and attentive. Crew multilingual as on most LX flight. Good choice of newspapers and magazines. wines are very good and food good but not up to standard when compared to other airlines. Seat is good and quite comfortable but certainly not the best in the sky. Once turned into a bed it is very comfortable with a good size duvet and a real pillow allowing a good rest. The fact of having only one WC for first class can be very bothersome especially just before landing when everyone uses it for changing.,0,8,Ender Ozsezen,2012-12-12,yes,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Return leg from BKK-AGP. As with the outbound all flights ran slightly early. Staff again professional and efficient and some friendlier than the normal Swiss staff. The Cabin Manger was very attentive and spoke to all passengers individually over dinner (interestingly he was in fact Spanish). Dinner as on the outbound was very good and as a late night departure quickly served which was appreciated. Fully flat beds again which is normal for the A340 and woken the usual 90 minutes prior to landing for a (very poor) breakfast which let this flight down. Could not find the arrivals lounge at Zurich but not important as has a shower at the departure lounge while waiting for the second flight. Again no complaints a full lunch with champagne served despite being 10.30am but acceptable as being awake for many hours and travelling in a different time zone. As always have no problem recommending Swiss.,0,8,D Gibson,2012-12-03,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,5,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,AGP to BKK via ZRH. All flights ran slightly early. I find Swiss to be consistently good but not fabulous. Prices in Business out of Spain always one of the best and makes the 7 hour layover in ZRH justifiable. Fully flat seat a little hard even after choosing soft function. One of the best steak meals ever enjoyed on a flight which was one of the celebrity chefs signature dishes. Champagne and drinks of good quality and usual service a little cold and slow but always polite.

Both times were extremely nice even with very short flights like Zurich-Milano you feel taken care of. Zurich-Cairo flight was very comfortable entertainment system was good. On the bad side the cabin crew repeated instructions every time in at least 4 languages (English French German and Swiss) it got a bit much sometimes.,0,9,Ahmad Moez,2012-11-08,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Birmingham - Zurich - Sao Paulo return. Last-minute on-the-day booking due to family circumstances. Flight from Birmingham to Zurich was late turning a tight connection into a stressful experience. Once on board the long haul run to Sao Paulo it was about as bearable as a 12-hour overnighter in economy can be. The return leg was similar - 12-hour overnighter from Zurich to Sao Paulo - I had pre-booked an aisle seat but was assigned at check-in to a middle seat - only when I threatened to call Swiss in Zurich did an aisle seat miraculously become available. However this turned out to be a rear seat with limited recline. As I am not a sleeper on night flights that was not a huge problem and it was good that the crew came around regularly with water. The food was standard fare - not good. 7-hour layover in Zurich was very welcome with the excellent Dayrooms facility at Zurich Airport. I was able to get 4 good hours of sleep before my onward flight and drive home. By the way I have rated the seat-comfort as very poor - this is not a reflection on Swiss - all economy seating is akin to purgatory on any long-haul.,0,7,T Hanan,2012-11-06,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,4,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,GVA-ZRH-EWR.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,JFK-GVA A330. I had been wait listed for Business from my full flexi economy ticket however all ground staff I talked to simply fobbed me off with 'only if there is a no show'. I had blocked 40k miles for this. Upon boarding was told business was full and was not going to happen. Strangely enough there was over 4 empty seats in Business when all passengers were seated. FA when asked said it was out of her control. In Economy - cabin was full and seat space is very compact. IFE is on demand however I found the screens even at the lowest brightness to be still very bright. Earphones painful after an hour. Food was acceptable however there was no choice only chicken provided. Breakfast was a croissant and yoghurt and the FA did come around again with a second batch of croissants. FA on our aisle was young and very friendly. However on occasion some of the older crew would come by barking orders at customers. Seat quality for sleeping is terrible new Recarro seats they should not be used for long haul. No possible way to get comfortable. The cabin temperature dropped massively during the night. Eventually the crew when torn away from their chatting at the back turned the temp back up. This was my first and last time using Swiss Long haul. Much better products out there.,0,4,K McCarthy,2012-10-30,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,3,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,NBO-ZRH. I was really looking forward to C class on Swiss and while it was fine it was not quite what I expected. Seats are full flat but getting into the flat position is awkward. Staff nice. Entertainment was only fair. Food was a let down. There was a late night supper with a less than exciting macaroni and cheese but dessert was quite good and the chocolates are a nice touch. Breakfast was decent. The arrival lounge at ZRH was great.,0,7,J Trevers,2012-10-30,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,4,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,ZRH-CPH-ZRH in C and ZRH-BCN and MUC-ZRH with LX in Y. Nothing noteworthy and the typical efficient Swiss flights in Europe as one could expect. Slight delay to BCN but on time from MUC and CPH. Staff a mix of friendly and cold but still better than some other airlines. Breakfast in C to and from CPH which was cheese with a fruit salad and warm bread and choice of sandwich between ZRH-BCN which is a nice change in Y. Swiss offers a consistent product but could improve on the cabin staff friendliness as this aspect is the inconsistent factor with Swiss and always has been. Staff in C is usually much friendlier though which is expected of course.,0,7,N Werner,2012-10-25,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,3,3,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Zürich-Bangkok on A340 on 21 October. Business class lounge in Zürich is very comfortable and has good facilities but a limited range of food and drink. Boarding was smooth and the flight on time. The quality and availability of food and drink on board were excellent. Staff were friendly and efficient. In lay-back mode I found the seat to be very comfortable and it seemed longer than the one on the A330; however in seated mode there is a hard area on the flat part of the seat that is a bit uncomfortable. Overall a very pleasant experience.,0,8,Michael Little,2012-10-23,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Florence-Zurich: unbelievable boarding procedure. Even though the flight was not fully booked Swiss had all passengers checking in any trolley hand-baggage including all those ones within permitted size and weight. All impacted passengers 80% of the flying ones including me got really upset. Swiss personnel were not really polite to passengers. One of other passengers told me that this procedure is common at Swiss Florence desk.,0,2,Tommaso Baccetti,2012-10-08,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,2,N/A,3,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,GVA-LCY-GVA. Received an SMS as arriving at GVA to be informed that flight was cancelled due to technical problems with the plane. Offered a switch to LHR but opted for morning flight to LCY instead. SWISS arranged for a nice 4* hotel with dinner and flew next morning. Full flight but good service chocolate croissant etc... Return flight not so busy. Problems can arise with any airline due to aircraft technical problems but it is how the airline deals with it that counts.,0,10,Jeff Michel,2012-10-08,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"LCY-BSL. Comment written bearing in mind that LX is selling themselves as a premium airline. Flight operated by Swiss European former Crossair aircraft. Instead of having a hand luggage baggage and a laptop bag decided to have everything in once piece of hand luggage. Resulted in a bit heavier rucksack but compared to other trolleys of other passengers still considerably lighter. (As I assisted fellow passengers placing their luggage). Maitre de Cabin decided that my rucksack had to go into the overhead bin which I agreed to and offered to assist. She declined assistance but when placing it in the bin she screamed down the whole aisle if I was carrying stones in it. Upon take off asked her very politely if that was professional and only got a sarcastic smile and a I dont care body movement. My fellow passengers around me where not amused as well. On top of that she talked about me and my rucksack with her colleague in Swiss German while serving food not considering that I might even speak Swiss German which I do. Snack was a weird cheese in ""curry"" sandwich that was left aside by many passengers. Usually they serve decent sandwiches though. Full bar service. In all slightly delayed but efficient flight. Let down by unprofessional FAs.",0,9,Mark Hurter,2012-10-04,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,1,5,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,JFK-Zurich-London City in A330 and RJ100.Smooth online check-in and bag drop at JFK. The lounge was pleasant but a limited range of food. Onboard the seat to Zurich was comfortable though when fully laid back was a little short for my 188cm length. The food and drink were excellent and service was exemplary. The transfer at Zurich airport was easy. On the RJ100 our bulkhead seats were comfortable enough and the cabin attendant was very attentive. A pleasant light meal was served and our suitcases arrived promptly. I recommend Swiss.,0,9,Michael Little,2012-10-04,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"Flew on 5 September Zurich to Los Angeles on LX40 Business Class a day flight of 11 hours. Shortly after lunch the cabin staff proceeded to close all the window blinds making the cabin dark as if it was a night flight and stopped people opening them until two hours before landing. This made it even harder to cope with jetlag as the plane arrived at around 5pm Pacific time and we were expected to go to sleep again. Complained to Swiss who basically said ""it's policy"". The selection offered in the entertainment system is poor and the food not brilliant when you consider what you pay for the ticket.",0,2,Ed Gelbstein,2012-10-02,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,2,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Overall a terrible experience. Two months before the flight I requested a bassinet for my daughter and asked Swiss to reserve seats for us close to bassinet. When I got onboard I found our seats far away from bassinet. We needed to ask people sitting in front to change their seats with ours. Additionally the cabin crew were very rude. When I requested a toy for my daughter the hostess reacted with an angry tone and said 'do not you see I am busy?'. She continued to show the same disrespectful behaviours during the flight. Moreover the food was an awful pasta dish.,0,1,O Buyukmutlu,2012-09-28,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,1,1,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,ARN-ZRH-PEK in economy. Overall we were happy with our flight to Peking. The service was good and the food was ok. Entertainment on the flight to Peking was on demand and they had a good selection of movies and series. Seats were fresh and comfy.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flying with Swiss longhaul is always a gamble when it comes to service. The hard product is usually pretty ok but in general the service provided is usually not that overwhelming and does not live up to their slogans. On a recent flight ZRH-NYC-ZRH this was again visible. The service to NYC was quite good and especially one flight attendant was very friendly and polite. The return leg was overshadowed by one flight attendant who was very rude and unfriendly and barking at passengers in a very brusque way when it came to the drinks service. The younger attendants seem to be better and still have that customer focus but still there is a long way to go to be world class.,0,6,N Werner,2012-09-27,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,3,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"ZRH-JNB in Business. Service was pathetic. You depart at 23.00 at night and it took more than one hour before they even started serving the drinks. I had to ask for my dessert 2.5 hours later. When I complained about the service to the head purser telling him that this was the worst service in C on Swiss ever the response was simply ""Really?"" The poor service continued the next morning. Breakfast was served consisting of bread a fruit salad and some cheese. Half an hour later they came around offering the eggs - everyone was however done eating by then. It so much depends on the crew on the flight. Most of the time I get the feeling they are just flying along with you not really there to serve you. Friendliness seems like a burden to the crew.",0,2,U Günther,2012-09-24,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,1,2,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Zurich to London Heathrow A320 easy check-in very nice lounge lovely airport. Slightly late departure due to late inbound aircraft.

Full aircraft but fast boarding. Very fast luggage retrieval at Heathrow.

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flew from Bangkok to Zurich return. I have mixed feelings about writing this review as the flight home was spectacular but the service on the flight over was amongst the worst I had ever experienced. Summary: Flights both legs were on time. Modern fleet in good condition - good inflight entertainment (would be great except poor quality headphones). Service terrible on way over. Attendants would not reply to bell and had to get up for water at night whilst attendants were talking at back of aircraft (they looked at me like it was an inconvenience when I asked for water - I felt like I was rude for asking). I must say however the crew on the flight home were the opposite and I could not speak highly enough of the service and would be amongst the best I have experienced. Anyway my overall opinion would be to give them a go as if it was anything like the way back I would recommend.,0,5,M Guerin,2012-09-23,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,0,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,JFK–GVA–JFK in economy. The aircraft seating and IFE were great. The food was appalling (even by airplane standard). The crew were disinterested and outright rude. I asked for a glass of water 4 hours in and was told to get it at the back galley. When I got there all the crew were sitting around chatting. They ran out of white wine within 90 minutes of leaving Geneva. Overall the service was really poor.,0,3,S Gold,2012-09-19,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,1,0,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,LHR to Palma Mallorca via Zurich outward on the 3rd July in Y class return on 10th July in C. Trouble free check in at Terminal 1 slight delayed departure to Zurich but we were kept informed and the crew came round with a tray of chocolates as we were waiting 10mins which was a nice touch. Spotlessly clean Airbus 321 with welcoming crew. Fresh croissants served with a hot drink. Plenty to keep you occupied during the connection at Zurich airport with a wide range of shops and facilities. Flight to Palma full legroom fine in Y class not cramped good quality Sandwich and hot and cold drinks again served by great flight attendants. 3D route map shown on overhead screens informative. Return in C class was fantastic I was booked on the 1735 departure from PMI but because the departure of that aircraft from ZRH was 30 mins delayed I was automatically switched to an earlier flight at 1630 to ZRH. PMI to ZHR was with Eidelweiss airlines (same group as Swiss) excellent meal in Business food was well presented and served professionally then a cheese board. The Lounge at Zurich is not the best food choice is rather limited but didn't need to eat. Onward connection to LHR busy but plenty of room in Business class more mature but professional crew meal and drinks served. Again well maintained aircraft interior. Sadly the problems started as we approached LHR as usual had to hold for 30 mins before landing and then they were not expecting us at the allocated air bridge so no staff were there to meet the aircraft. After waiting 15 mins they did find a member of the ground staff and we had to disembark via the rear exit onto buses which took us to the terminal as they could not use the airbridge.,0,10,T Charles,2012-09-12,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flew on three sectors. LHR-ZRH ZRH-GVA and GVA-JFK. European flights were pretty standard business class. Coach class seating but with a light meal and wine thrown in. Crew on European flights were absolutely delightful. Geneva New York on an A330 on 15 August 2012 was delightful. Seats not super comfortable but they are lie-flat. Food was really not very palatable but that's true of virtually every airline. Wines were lovely deserts were nice. Crew were attentive. The aircraft was immaculate with larger than usual washrooms. Would happily fly them again.,0,10,L Cameron-Lewis,2012-09-05,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,5,4,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,"My flight was direct from Zurich to Los Angeles and I had it booked online two months ago. First of all Swissair had changed my flight status to Standby because they had over booked which was very upsetting to me. I was finally able to get on the flight just to find out that my seat was right in ""front"" of the toilet door! I had never been in a plane where they had taken out a set of toilets to add passenger seats there! Not only did I and the other two passengers next to me had to tolerate the stench from the bathrooms the whole flight we also had to tolerate the heigh traffic of passengers using those bathrooms and the loud noise of the flushes on a constant basis! I also had no leg room because they had placed a metal case under the passenger seat in front of me! I really expected so much more from the Swiss!",0,1,Golnar Rahbaran,2012-09-04,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,5,1,Swiss International Air Lines
Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Lounge in Oslo average at best. Oslo - Zurich leg delayed due to late incoming aircraft from Zurich. I have flown this leg 4 times and it has been delayed 3 out of 4. So much for the alleged Swiss punctuality. Service and food pretty good with friendly crew. With a short connection in Zurich and due to the delay transferring passengers to Delhi were driven from gate to gate. Nice (and necessary) gesture. Promised that baggage would make it too but this was not to be the case. Service on Zurich - Delhi leg pretty average even below average at times. The maitre de cabine was more interested in chatting with a non-rev passenger than answering call-buttons resulting in a 30 minute wait to have faulty earphones changed. Was then brought yet another pair of faulty earphones. Three is a charm. Wine was good food below average. Starter dry and practically inedible main course badly presented. Crew slightly disorganized and looked tired and harassed. Second meal service was tasty but insubstantial in amount resulting in landing slightly hungry in Delhi. Informed by the maitre de cabine that luggage did not make it who was very apologetic. Ground staff in Delhi delightful and did their best to lessen the inconvenience. Took 1.5 days to receive luggage which is a shame on a three day business trip. Claim for compensation for expenditure is still unanswered. On return trip used Lufthansa lounge in Delhi. Pretty good offering but a bit too small and no showers. Delhi - Zurich leg ok seated in the comfy Stübli with extra room for legs. Light snack before sleeping for 4-5 hours on the fully flat bed. Breakfast too insubstantial unfortunately. Service slightly rushed and somewhat disorganized. No amenities in bathroom. With a slight delay transfer in Zurich was a hassle having to run through long corridors security immigration train etc (no car this time). Zurich - Oslo leg pretty good but again slightly delayed. Crew pretty good however food offering should change more often as they have had the same breakfast for years.,0,6,E Vegard,2012-09-03,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,3,3,Swiss International Air Lines

Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Flight Hong Kong to Zurich. A night flight and so the sleeping position was a key test. The seat makes up into a fully flat slightly narrow but very comfortable bed. The seat layouts are unusual and I was in the K rows which are all single window seats. The shelf and storage spaces are much better than many business seats and the table for meals also large. Meals were tastefully served by smiling staff.

On check in at Heathrow they said I would have to pay as I had been given the wrong information. I was treated very poorly and made to feel like I was making it up.
