"""got charged $600 excess baggage""","Qantas gouging. My wife and I just got charged $600 excess baggage for 2 ski bags flying Brisbane to LA. Allowance is 32 kgs. and my combined luggage weight was 24kgs. Qantas website reads.  ‘Snow skis and snowboards must be protected in a ski bag. If the snow skiing equipment and your checked bags exceed your checked baggage allowance, airport excess baggage rates apply.’  I assumed this is combined total weight.

"“crews seemed disinterested, disorganised”","I recently flew Perth-Singapore (QF71) and return (QF72) both sectors in Business class and was very disappointed in the flights from start to finish. The crews seemed to be disinterested, disorganised and in the main, unfriendly. Apparently, there is a new drinks/meals system on board where the they take drink orders prior to take-off for your post departure drinks. The drinks are brought to your seat after take-off rather than crew wheeling the trolley down the aisle for you to make your choice. The whole procedure seemed chaotic as orders were mixed up and passengers brought the wrong drinks. The ordering of the meal was equally as disorganised with crew darting around the cabin taking random orders and then frequently having to check which meals had run out. On the return journey, I ordered a glass of champagne for my post departure drink but was advised no Champagne had been ordered and there was none on board. I guess there's a first for everything and I honestly thought they were joking. They offered me a cheap sparkling which I declined and chose a wine instead. The meals have reverted back to being served on a small tray plonked on to the tablecloth provided. Why? Something to do with less movement around the cabin apparently. Honestly, I have praised Qantas business class over the years, but if this latest ""streamlined"" service is anything to go by, I'll be travelling on another airline.",1,3,C Davidson,2024-12-08,no,Business Class,Solo Leisure,Singapore to Perth,December 2024,4,2,4,1,2,Qantas Airways

"""Shameful Attitude""","Shameful Attitude, Shameful purser, 2 hours delay w/o any care for passengers. Traveling from Sydney to Jakarta (arriving at 7 pm), I would have a following flight at 10:45 pm (with Air China) to Beijing, then to Madrid than to Sao Paulo (all connected). I chose Qantas (over Garuda) as Qantas has a good on-time reputation, taking flight QF41 (October 2nd). While taxiing  the pilot discovered a minor engine issue, which caused a 2-hour delay for takeoff, which means I had only 1:45 hour connection time - extremely short. Extremely worried, I discussed my worries with a flight attendant, she assured me that the plane would fly faster, arriving in Jakarta at 8 pm, “…no need to worry, as I would have plenty of time.” Unfounded promise – the flight arrived at Jakarta at 9 pm (2 hours late). 40 minutes before landing I approached the purser told him about my critical situation (3 flights in a row, depending in 10:45 pm Air China) and asked him to help me assigning a Qantas ground staff to help me with migration/customs or to get in touch with Air China for them to help me. The Purser was not impressed from my desperate situation and said they have few people, and he will try to help. When the plane arrived, the purser totally ignored me, nothing was done to help me out or give any solution.

"""staff seemed indifferent and inattentive""","Qantas QF93, September 23 (MEL to LAX) Class: Business (upgraded using 110k QF Points x 2 = 220k Points) Seats: 26E and 26F (upgraded from classic economy rewards seat) My recent experience on Qantas flight QF93 from Melbourne to Los Angeles left much to be desired, especially considering it was in Business Class. Unfortunately, the service did not meet the standards I have come to expect from Qantas.  Both meal services during the flight were extremely late. The final meal wasn’t served until around 50 minutes before landing in Los Angeles, which was quite frustrating, particularly since passengers in Economy and Premium Economy had already finished their meals almost two hours earlier. For Business Class passengers, this was unacceptable. Despite having my breakfast order taken at the beginning of the flight, the meal I selected wasn’t available when it was time to serve. Worse still, I wasn’t informed about the change, and no apology was offered. I only realized the mistake when I saw my wife, seated next to me, received the meal we had both ordered, while I was given something else. This lack of communication and attention to detail was quite disappointing.  The service from the crew on my side of the aisle (seat 26E) was noticeably poor. The staff seemed indifferent and inattentive, making me feel uncomfortable when requesting basic service. Their attitude fell far below what one would expect in Business Class, and it affected the overall enjoyment of the flight. Upon trying to file a formal complaint with Qantas, I was surprised to find that their system does not allow complaints about the cabin crew. I had to categorize my complaint under “aircraft condition,” which felt inappropriate, as the issue was clearly with the staff's professionalism. Final Thoughts: Despite being a loyal Qantas passenger, this flight was a disappointment. The hard product (seating and amenities) was solid, but the inefficiency and unprofessional behavior of the cabin crew, combined with the frustrating experience of dealing with meal service, were hard to overlook. It’s unfortunate that Qantas’ complaint system doesn’t allow for feedback about staff performance directly, which further adds to my frustration. I still rate the experience a 2/5 primarily because the overall product is good, but service like this makes me question if the premium Business Class fare is worth it.",1,2,D Hameer,2024-10-03,no,Business Class,Family Leisure,Melbourne to Los Angeles,September 2024,5,1,4,1,1,Qantas Airways

"""service has gone substantially downhill""","Flew Adelaide to Cairns via Sydney in Business Class. Qantas lounge in Adelaide is under renovation and whatever those renovations end up as can only be an improvement. Food was limited to 2 choices of bland rubbish and the coffee was poor. Adelaide to Sydney (737) the service commenced over halfway through the flight and the food was very average. Economy class had all been served before drinks were offered in Business Class. Qantas Lounge in Sydney was ok. Food again was very limited and poor but at least the bar was open. Sydney to Cairns (737) was good with decent food and consistent topping up of drinks from attentive attendants. The flight being half full, if that, no doubt had an impact. Cairns to Adelaide via Brisbane. The morning flight was delayed by an hour which ended up being 2. The lounge in Cairns was marginally better than Adelaide with actual breakfast offerings but overall the Qantas lounge experience is poor to average. Mainly just poor. Cairns to Brisbane was on an Alliance E190 and the plane was filthy. There was rubbish from previous flight(s) in the seat pocket, under the seat and jammed between the seat and the wall. Additionally the floors did not look like they had been vacuumed for a long time and no other surface wiped down. The service was bad, late and poor quality. On descent into Brisbane passengers were advised of any connecting flight due to the significant delay. Our connecting flight was to be on the same aircraft and gate with a 'quick turnaround'. As such we (thought we) had no time to wait in the Qantas lounge and remained at the gate. The boarding time kept being pushed back every 15 minutes with the excuse of 'catering and cleaning' offered. On reboarding to the same seat the plane was in the same condition with the rubbish still in place. The catering was no different with the same garbage being served up and I had to use the call button for the first time in my life to get any response from the FA. Arrived home late I used to rate Qantas but their in flight service has gone substantially downhill, which appears to be a consistent theme in the reviews. Had I flown economy I wouldn't bother leaving a review because you get what you pay for. But these were 4 Business Class flights and overall they were a colossal waste of money. So there is no point flying domestic business. The extra few 1000 $ would go a long way in the airport proper Of note Qantas only requested a review of the Sydney - Cairns flight (the only one likely to elicit positivity). They clearly knew the other 3 would be slated so don't bother requesting a review which would balance out any internal ratings to 'lift your game or I'm going with the competition'. Not there really is any which means Qantas can keep charging premium fares for less than what low cost carriers used to provide Don't recommend them anymore but since you don't have any choice keep your money and/or points and sit at the back",0,2,P Murray,2024-09-24,no,Business Class,Couple Leisure,Adelaide to Cairns via Sydney,September 2024,2,1,4,2,1,Qantas Airways

It tasted stale and lacked any semblance of freshness. Even the bread roll was hard and dry, making it nearly inedible. To make matters worse, the meal options were extremely limited, and there were no decent alternatives for passengers with dietary restrictions.

"""Another horrific flight""","Another horrific flight endured with Qantas. 6 hour delay on departure from Sydney - 3 different explanations as to why water had apparently saturated seats while parked at the gate. The Captain stated a problem with a door caused water to enter the aircraft and engineers needed to do a very careful test - decompression risks? VH-OQI was the operating ac. Ground staff and engineering estimates initially 30 minute delay, then 60 minute, then 120 minute, then 180 minute, then 'we don""t know'. $15 vouchers handed around at 2, 4 and 5 hour mark - passengers eating junk /snack food for 6 hours instead of a proper dinner. Arrogant ground staff defensive and argumentative to reasonable questions, inviting argument and disrespectful. Once on board - polite, apologetic captain. Food shocking in economy - inedible beef 'burger' a glutinous mess of reconstituted potato mash, frozen carrots and peas and undercooked beef mince drowned in gravy. Literally disgusting and warm at best. Served 3 hours into the 7 hour flight - 11.30pm to midnight Sydney time. Female First Officer buttered the landing in Singapore, smoothest aspect of the whole experience. Singapore to London sector - used a gate with a single security lane to board from 3am for a 4.05am departure. Actual departure 4.57am. Quoting Captain ""Obviously we wont be on time, 30 minutes late because of manpower issues here at Singapore and five and a half hours because the plane needed to be fixed"". No apology. Sounded completely disinterested in even making an announcement - shouldn't have bothered. His arrogance was the only thing he informed us of. One small bottle of water given for the whole flight to passengers, the refills only in little plastic cups.

As a result of organising other flights to get back home due to their inconvenience caused do you think QANTAS offered any reimbursement for costs incurred. Simple answer no.

Seeing the airline I knew they were not going to do anything but they did reply after a week and asked me to take my luggage for survey. According to the Bag store my damaged bags couldn't get repaired so after of sending emails in and out Qantas agreed to pay a mere compensation of 27 aud for 2 damaged bags. When I mailed them saying it was not fair they said they had closed my case and 0 compensation received. What sort of airline is this?

"""Never flying you ever again""","Horrible experience flying with Qantas, will never recommend anyone flying with them.  We had a long multi port trip booked with Qantas from Queenstown to Jakarta many last minute adjustments including moving us to a low cost carrier Jetstar which ultimately was delayed made us miss a flight and had to be booked a hotel due to their terrible, terrible flight planning. Their digital check in system at Sydney airport doesnt even work from the check in all the way to bag drop, ultimately forcing ppl to raise their hands for assistance which leads to a chaotic queuing system being so disorganized and causing a huge pile of people frustrated just waiting to get their machines running. Their customer service are not capable to handle issues effectively as they were not solution-oriented - only looking to solve whats easiest for her, not for the collective of the passengers, We are never flying Qantas or Jet Star ever again! We initially booked our return flight from Jakarta to Queenstown in Qantas flight and we paid a full price (not a promo fare). The return flight consisted of 3 connecting flights, from Queenstown to Sydney, Sydney to Singapore then Singapore to Jakarta. They rescheduled our connecting flight from Singapore to Jakarta and it became a 16 hour layover in Singapore (and we were supposed to land at 10 PM SGT). So we booked a hotel room by the Singapore airport hoping to get a good night sleep before catching the flight back home. However, on the day of our departure from Queenstown, just as we got to the airport we were told by the staff that the Qantas flight from Queenstown to Sydney has been changed to a Jet Star flight and it got delayed for an hour which caused us to miss our connecting flights. When we landed in Sydney, we ran to our gate but the plane has left. We asked the Qantas staff there asking for clarity and she said “this is a Jetstar problem, not our problem”? In the end we got to the transit desk and sorted out our next flight (next day). Here we are today 26th of April 2024. We checked in for our flight, the kiosk machine had so many issues on it and there were a lot of lines piling up, we ended up have to get one of the Qantas staff to help. Afterwards we had to drop our bag thru the machine (again automated but not working as it was supposed to). Mind you, this was not only our machine, it was all the Qantas bag drop machines at the airport that were not working, so again, the line was piling up. We asked a Qantas staff what had happened and what should we do, as we’ve been waiting in front of a non working machine for a good 30 minutes. She explained a bit of what happened, and ask us to wait again for god knows how long without giving any other solutions. I told her nicely that it was not nice to wait, then she talked back to me “oh its not nice to wait? Then find somewhere else to drop it!” What a service Qantas! Never flying you ever again.

"""they treat customers terribly""","Qantas flight QF76 (codeshare Westjet) which left Vancouver for Sydney on 13 April diverted to Honolulu. Allegedly 1 of 3 major electrical systems failed and the plane had to land. We were closer to Fiji at the time but Qantas decided to turn back to Honolulu. We went to Qantas's hotel and the flight was rescheduled for 27 hours later. No problem. We were told by Qantas staff that buses would pick us up at the hotel the next day to take us to the airport at 7:30am. However, no buses showed up. We received no contact from Qantas but a rumour went around that the flight was delayed. We received no texts, or emails about the delay and the Manage Booking page which not work for anyone on our flight. A rumour went around that our flight was leaving later that day. Everyone went to the airport at their own expense. Bags were checked and people went through security. After multiple hours of waiting, the flight was delayed again as Qantas had sent the wrong plane from Sydney to bring passengers back to Sydney. The rested crew were unable to fly that type of plane. Finally, a message was received by email saying that flight was delayed until 9am the following morning. People left the airport at their own cost. We went to the airport the following morning at our cost again. This time the plane did take off. But not all passengers were told by text/email about the new flight. They were asking passengers to agree to stay in Honolulu for extra days at check-in as the plane was smaller than the one that had flown us in from Vancouver. Due to the failure to communicate, there were empty seats. On the flight back, we ran out of catered food. I fly frequently and have never seen this happen. The stewarts had not even reached half way down the plane when they ran out of one choice... People who ordered special meals did not get same as this information was not transferred from our original Vancouver - Sydney flight to this new flight. At the time, Qantas was saying that it would reimburse us for taxi's to the airport, food, nights accomodation missed in Sydney. Qantas is now refusing to pay. It will not even reimburse me for my seats which I paid for but did not get. I, like most, have travel insurance. However, there is an excess. I have been diddled too many times by Qantas. At the beginning of the pandemic, I agreed to leave my credit with Qantas as I thought it would help with cashflow and help maintain the Qantas. In response I was offered an extra 25% credit on top of the credit I would get for my cancelled flight. I went to rebook afterwards when Qantas resumed international flights. I found that the price of flights for people using credit was higher than for people booking and paying with a credit card. I booked several domestic flights in early 2022 which were cancelled and got to no refund/credit. I used to love flying Qantas. The food is good, when there is sufficient available, and the frontline staff are nice.

They were very helpful, but came back with a message from Qantas. “We do not make fare changes for medical emergencies”. I have medical certificates/documents to back up our claim. The return portion of our air fare is approximately $2250 for both of us. Qantas’ “offer” for compensation is $15 each. Apart from being ridiculous, it’s an insult.

"""Poor service and insensitive staff""","On 2 April 2024, I (together with my spouse and parents) flew Adelaide to Melbourne and thereafter Melbourne to Singapore. All legs were Qantas Airlines. In Adelaide, I was issued the boarding pass for both legs and the seats were assigned. The staff that attended to us in Adelaide was very friendly and accommodating. In Melbourne, it was a real chaos. At the boarding gate, the staff arrived late and was not able to provide clear instructions to passengers on how they were boarding. The passengers were expected to go down an escalator before going through the boarding gate and due to poor instruction and management, there was safety risks (especially for old people) of being pushed over by anxious passengers. When I arrived at the Business Class queue, the lady at the counter (without looking at my tickets), pointed us to the economy class queue. Well, it did not end there. When asked for clarification, she said that she assumed we were economy class. Thereafter, I was not able to scan my boarding pass which was issued in Adelaide because I was assigned another seat without my permission. The excuse being, the electronic device was not working. I was separated from my spouse. Qantas entertainment can be access through tablet (if the flight device was not working) which I had. Regardless, my seat was taken away (without permission) and given to another passenger which I later found out was the partner of the said flight pilot. To make matters worst, when I left my seat to use the lavatory, the flight attendant poured water into my glass of unfinished wine and there was not an ounce of apology.

"""genuine improvement in service""","Over the last 18 months I have flown Qantas several time, largely from Sydney to Melbourne and return or Sydney to Brisbane and return. During that time I have experienced a genuine improvement in service, punctuality and professionalism of the crew. My most recent flight Sydney - Melbourne - Sydney was as good as it could ever be. The flights were punctual, the crew were very welcoming and the aircraft was impeccably clean and operational. Crew actively helped passengers to be comfortable by hanging up jackets, helping to arrange luggage and checking to see if more help was required. From Melbourne to Sydney on 18th March I sat in an aisle seat and stood up to let the window passenger access to the aisle for the bathroom. Instantly the steward appeared and offered to hold my glass of water so it did not spill during this process. To do this shows he was proactively looking for ways to assist passengers. That is outstanding service. Food in Business class was excellent and presented with pride and good grace. Food in Economy was also quite good and again served very professionally. The point I really want to make is that over the last two years service has improved to the point of being quite exceptional and the journeys have been pleasant as a result. Just in case you think that might apply only to Business, I can assure you that I have experienced the same warm welcomes and professional approach in Economy.

"""let down by its representatives""","As the only airline flying direct DFW to SYD, I paid a premium fare well in excess of $8000 for Business Class. Lounge arrangements in DFW prior to flight good and embarkation and initial welcome with a glass of champagne worked efficiently. That was the last process that did. Fair to say the business class configuration in this aircraft is the best I have experienced - excellent storage, easy controls and good touch screen entertainment options. Shortly after takeoff I was asked for my dinner and breakfast orders, duly provided. Not sure why I was asked to select from the three dinner choices on the menu - only one of the choices was available and it was the one that I would least desire. I was not asked whether I wanted a refreshment of any sort at that time and, by observation, nor were any of my neighbours. Almost two hours elapsed before any member of the flight crew came near me. Then it was to deliver my dinner. I asked to see the wine-list because the wines had not been included on the dinner menu, as is the practice with all other major airlines recently flown. The response was that they don't have a wine list - they just serve what is loaded on board. I was advised that I could have red or white - no attempt to explain the characteristics of different available wines - clearly didn't have a clue. I chose to have a Shiraz - the bottle was produced but was from a producer I have never heard of. Hardly a good advertisement for Australian wines on the national carrier. The only available meal was a fillet cooked to order. Medium rare it was not - well done a better description. During the meal there was no crew attention to top up wine or water. Next flight crew contact was when tray was removed. No question of offering an aperitif or coffee. From takeoff to dinner clearance the flight crew appeared more interested in chatting to each other near the galley than serving their customers. After dinner, no attempt by flight crew in my section of business class to assist passengers with getting their bedding set up for the overnight flight. Definitely a self help situation. About an hour before landing I realised that I had not been provided with a landing card. I approached one of the flight crew who stated, somewhat arrogantly as though it ws my fault, ""you should have been given one"". All in all, this flight was another affirmation that airline customer experiences are largely in the hands of the flight crew. Once again, Qantas was let down by its representatives and, to some degree by the quality of the food and wine presented.

They emailed early on the day of the flight to say the entertainment system was broken and to prepare. This is crazy for a long haul flight and the plane came from Sydney so how could they not have addressed this issue before flying to China. So nothing worked. No movies, no map, no safety video. Also, on board they said people should download on Netflix knowing full well that Chinese people have no access to Netflix. So basically they ignored the problems Chinese people might face. The seats were one of the smallest I’ve ever sat on. It was so tight and the whole cabin felt cluttered and poorly laid out. In addition, the material of the pillow meant everything was sticking to it so it looked really gross and dirty. The toilets were also super gross and the whole experience felt unhygienic.  The meal was appealing I can barely put it into words. Usually I take a photo of my plane food as generally I like it. There was just one container of meat or veg or whatever you ordered and a piece of bread. No nice tray or cups or no presentation at all. The breakfast was the same. Really below expectations for a long haul flight. The plane left shanghai over 2 hours late. Nothing was offered for these 2 hours. The cabin crew were nice but quite inattentive. While waiting to go to the restroom, a Chinese lady asked for hot water. There were a lot of cabin crew and not one person helped her even though it was obvious was she needed and she asked. After about five minutes someone helped her. They seem to prioritize white people so if you fall into this category you’re lucky. I complained about my experience as it was so terrible and the flight wasn’t cheap. They offered my $100 travel credit which can be used on a future flight. I’m not from Australia and I have no plans to return in the near future so this isn’t really helpful. To conclude, Qantas is a really disappointing airline with a terrible service, dirty and compact cabins, poor food quality  I would never fly with them again. Fortunately after landing I had a good experience in Australia. It’s a shame that this airline is the first thing a lot of people will encounter when coming to Australia.

"""disappointing to say the least""","As a member of the One World Alliance elites, I expected a certain level of service and professionalism from Qantas, but sadly, it fell short of my expectations. The overall effort put forth by the airline appeared to be lackluster, as if they were just doing enough to avoid being classified as subpar. The lack of enthusiasm and genuine care was evident from the moment I stepped into the airport at SYD. From the airport crew to the in-flight staff, it seemed that the airline was putting in the least minimal effort, giving off an impression that they simply did not care about providing a quality service. One major disappointment was the absence of smiles from anyone within the Qantas staff.  Instead of focusing on their duties, flight attendant were often found chit-chatting and gossiping among themselves while serving food and drinks. This not only reflected a lack of commitment to their responsibilities but also created a negative atmosphere for passengers. What struck me as particularly concerning was a flight attendant making low-class comments and mocking a sleeping passenger.  In conclusion, my experience with Qantas was disappointing, to say the least. The lack of genuine effort, professionalism, and respect for passengers left me questioning the commitment of the airline to deliver a quality travel experience. I expected more from Qantas, and it is disheartening to see them fall short of delivering a service that matches the standards of the alliance.",1,2,T Huang,2024-01-16,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,Sydney to Los Angeles,January 2024,2,2,2,1,1,Qantas Airways

Me and my wife had to sit separately on the same flight. Secondly the flight got delayed by over 5 hours. The first delay was of 1 hour that they conveyed by email. The second delay was of another 1 hour that again was sent by an email. Later on the plane arrived late by another 1 hour at the airport and then due to some error they delayed the flight for another 2 and a half hours. What poor service by QANTAS.

The flight time was fairly quick so we landed in Brisbane early. Onboard catering was very nice and a lovely crew who looked after us in the air. Bags were late arriving due to a thunderstorm and lightning meant the ground crew had to leave the tarmac. I still made my family event with plenty of time to spare. Qantas prices can sometimes be extremely high. So I guess I was lucky to find a bargain at relatively short notice.

Admittedly we were advised of these lengthy delays by email but no explanation was given at all. When we finally boarded in Melbourne, there were no pillows or blankets provided at all and it was absolutely freezing. Our flights to Perth were also rather stressful as being elderly, we looked for assistance in Sydney but after being refused 3 times by busy staff, we gave up and joined a very disgruntled queue hoping like hell that we would have time to catch our connecting flight which we basically had to run to catch!

"""staff at Hobart was rude and unfriendly""","My JetStar flight got cancelled and we got rescheduled to take Qantas. The staff serving us on 10 Dec at Hobart was rude and unfriendly to cut off my question when I wanted to ask something. Minimal eye contact was given to us when she served us. I asked my question early as I did not want her to relook into the seats if she was already on the screen. Thus I asked early only to be cut off by her saying not now. As she was dealing with my seats, I requested for front rows if it’s possible. She gave us the worst seats (behind the toilet door) and we were the first in queue of the economy class to checked in. On the system, we did see other available seats. Not only did she just gave us a lousy seats, she did not even inform us and was just rushing to serve us and end the service. Especially when the staff knew we were from a rescheduled flight from Jetstar, their faces expression changed to a smiley polite face to an annoyed and look down face as though we were not worthy to be served. I’m disappointed as I saw her handling other customers with a much more warm look than us. This lady was in a hurry to serve us and because I requested to sit tgt, I think she got annoyed and gave us bad seats for a long haul 8h20min flight. In addition, My friend’s luggage was 26kg and she requested for the staff to paste a fragile sticker on her luggage. However, she did not do so and commented that “your luggage is so heavy that they won’t be able to throw it around”. Thus she went on to place the heavy tag and no fragile sticker.

“The crew did a great job”,"Check in was a bit of a joke as the system would not allow me to fully web check in. We spent nearly 1 hour in the queue as there were only 3 staff on the desks and 1 was tied up for most of the hour dealing with some passengers who had not done something correctly and were expecting the check-in agent to sort it out for them. Boarding was a bit of a shambles with additional checks of the passport and boarding passes being done by private security people for god knows why and the Qantas staff member in charge of this not giving clear directions to us leaving us almost as confused as she was. This led to a 90 minute delay which we expected. The pilots managed to make up 1/2 hour on the way, but it was nice approaching Los Angeles in daylight. On Board: The crew did a great job looking after us and regularly patrolled the aircraft offering snacks and water. They were friendly down to earth people form a variety of national backgrounds. Food wasn't in huge portions but adequate and I enjoyed it. We booked seats 82 and 83 A and B so we had window seats. I can't confirm it, but I believe that Qantas blocked off the C seats for us, which was great of them to do if they did that as it made our trip even more comfortable. There was no wifi on the aircraft due to it flying over the Pacific Ocean and being out of any sort of coverage, but there was plenty on offer on the entertainment system. For economy, the seats were comfortable enough for the 14 hour trip with plenty of legroom, however, the arm rests don't go up fully. The seats can also be reclined with out intruding in the passenger behind you's space. I felt a bit sorry for the people who would be cleaning the aircraft after we left, as there was a family of grubs in front of us who allowed their child to spill food and rubbish all over the carpet in their seats as well as the aisle. Some of it even managed to float down our way. My advice to passengers is that they treat crew with respect and they will get it back, take your rubbish to the bins yourself - the crew aren't your personal servants and if you have children who can't entertain themselves, then teach them how to use headphones so the rest of the passengers don't have to hear their entertainment.",0,9,Tony Maddern,2023-12-18,yes,Economy Class,Family Leisure,Melbourne to Los Angeles,December 2023,4,4,2,5,5,Qantas Airways

But fortunately for us, the flying Kangaroo delivered a 7.5 to 8 experience on our short hop over to NZ from Sydney. QF3 is a one stop at Auckland on route to NYC and luckily we only had the short 3 hour first leg and not the extended 16 hour marathon. The flight was slightly delayed out of Sydney about 30-40 mins from memory - incoming flight delayed and this aircraft had to be towed over from hanger. Newer Boeing 787. Baggage drop off at Kingsford Smith was a do it yourself affair as is pretty common now and quite flawless and with printed boarding pass in hand it was a smooth passage though boarder control and security for a quick bite and beverage before heading up to the gate. Qantas gate attendants were great and we did get some announcements to keep us informed of progress on the delay. Staff were observant and without any prompting at boarding allowed our group to board early as one of us has some mobility difficulties. This worked out fantastic as we were seated towards the rear of the plane and greatly assisted minimise extended standing to get aboard. A very big thank you to the attentive staff and their passenger care. The plane was a newer aircraft and seating etc good, pleasantly surprised to find no entertainment box on the floor under the seats to obstruct leg/foot room as is the case with some 787's. Not the biggest screen, nor the best legroom or width but on par with this product and seating class. There was an issue with the head phone jack connection to the armrest that was faulty and interfered with watching movies etc. Was reported to cabin staff. Was tolerable for 3 hours but would be a real pain if having to jingle the connector for 16hrs. Plane was pretty full. The entertainment is usual Qantas fair and would rate it as pretty good and better than most (excepting Emirates and Qatar). Very happy with product. On board service and cabin crew were great - no complaint or issue - pleasant, friendly and did their jobs well. Food - was surprisingly good and tasty - excellent for the short 3 hr hop and 8 out of 10. Have had some very poor offerings from Qantas on other trips but great on this one. We got to NZ a little behind time but luckily for us no biggy. Qantas delivered with meeting their primary obligations in my view; Got us up safely, flew us over safely and got us down safely without issue or incident - just what i'd expect and paid for. The delay is fine and happy to sit in an airport or fly next day if there are any safety issues rather than have a drama in the air. The nice food and great service were nice bonuses to have and appreciated. To my experience - generally Qantas have delivered a 7.5 to 8 level of service.

Cabin crew on all four legs of the trip were friendly, helpful and professional. Meals on offer were with one exception, tasty, well presented and plentiful. CONS - At best I would classify BC on the 737-800 as PE with a hefty price attached. The seats were wide enough and leg room satisfactory but the recline was minimal (certainly not lie flat) and the supposed leg rest would be fine if the customer was 5 foot in height or less. The seat buttons for recline and the leg rest were unresponsive requiring a lot of prodding to elicit any movement in either direction The touch TV screen is tiny, slow to respond and with a very limited choice. Only one amenity kit was offered on the Denpasar - Melbourne leg. Contents basic and little point offering a dental kit if the toilet (tiny with no amenities except soap) does not supply disposable cups to rinse one’s mouth. No pillow provided on the Wellington Melbourne and return leg; no hot towels offered and even worse not even a disinfectant wipe provided with the meal trays to clean one’s hands before/ after eating. With the 12 BC seats situated right behind the galley the noise from cupboards/doors being opened and shut by crew in the galley and able to overhear conversations between crew members was pretty annoying and the ear plugs provided were much too large. Cabin cleanliness was poor - grubby dog eared safety instructions and magazine, crumbs, dust, smeared TV screen and seat leather in need of a good cleaning Despite the crew being professional the same could not be said of the standard of uniform.

"""More disgusting service""","More disgusting service from everyone's favourite airline. 50% more expensive than JetStar and still the same abysmal service. They sent me an invitation to buy a one time use of their Qantas Lounge in Melbourne. since I had a 3 hour stop there I thought it would be a nice idea to try it out. Now keep in mind, that some genius in their marketing department thought it would be a good idea to razzle dazzle a new potential regular customer by sending me this special ""VIP Offer"". You know, let me experience how wonderful the lounge is and then I might buy permanent access to it and further improve their fat profits. I thought it was odd that they only sent the invite to me and not my wife who was travelling with me. But the invite said I could forward it to the others I was travelling with and they can enjoy it to. Sadly or should I say expectedly, no matter how we tried to use the pass, access the site or complete a 2nd purchase their system would not allow me to do so. I figured if I bought one and they were trying to convince me to become a full fee paying client I would simply be able to explain the website issues and buy the 2nd pass at the counter when I walked in. Alas, it was not to be. all I got was excuses, rules about this and that and then a bunch of terse mouthy rudeness from the catty ladies when I displayed the slightest bit of frustration at their lack of ability to fix a simple situation. ""Your welcome to use your pass Sir"" yea.. i'll just wave at my wife through the window while I enjoy my free coffee. Once again, Qantas could have made money, pleased a customer and made flying with them a pleasure, but instead they ensured I will do everything I can to avoid flying with them again.  After flying Air NZ on the way over and enjoying their nearly newplane, with complimentary Wifi, and lovely staff with great service, the stark difference in how not to do things by Qantas was pulpable. every metric was comparably, utter garbage compared to Air NZ.

"""$100 refund for a $510 ticket""","On the 18th of October, I needed to cancel my return flight Melbourne to Canberra. I went online and it gave me two options – cancel for credit, or cancel for money. It told me to ‘check my ticket for the rules’. I did this – there was nothing on my ticket about the rules that I could discernibly locate. I clicked ‘cancel for money’, but I was on a call with Qantas as I was doing this (on hold for half an hour, as per usual). Five minutes after clicking – ‘cancel for refund/money’ – I spoke to someone (9.35am approx.). She asked me, ‘have you just requested a refund, online?” I said, “Yes, I have – should I have done this?” “Yes, that is okay,” she said. “Will I get a refund?” I asked. “Yes,” she said. At no point did she tell me it was only the taxes being refunded. I confirmed again, “would I receive a refund” – she said yes. At no point did she divulge it was only a tiny proportion of the ticket - $100 refund for a $510 ticket. After ending the call I then received an email, saying that I would only receive a refund, depending on the rules of the ticket (what are the rules? Did this email tell me? No of course not). So, again – even after calling – I’m looking at the app, I’m chasing down the paper ticket and looking at it again. I’m a fairly smart person, but I can’t find anything – incredibly obtuse rules. So, I have to call again and I’m on hold for half an hour. This time, I speak to a man. I tell him the situation. He said, “did the previous person you speak to check your ticket rules?” “No,” I said. “She should have checked, and cancelled the refund request. She should have requested a ‘cancel for credit’ for you. You would have received a full credit. Did she tell you this?” “No she did not.” “Did she tell you that you would only receive a partial refund?” “No she did not. She did not tell me anything of the sort.” He says, “there’s nothing I can do.” This is Qantas – the spirit of Australia.",0,1,Emma Rowe,2023-10-19,no,Economy Class,Business,Melbourne to Canberra,October 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,Qantas Airways

(October 2023) After months of fighting to at least get some kind of answer and a compensation, they finally paid the maximum fee for lost luggage.

“a disappointing experience”,"One of the worst flight experiences of my entire life. The entertainment on the flight did not work, flight attendants refused to help with basic inquiries and were rude to my Dad and myself when serving us meals and providing us with necessary equipment to ensure the flight’s convenience. The flight experience was highly turbulent and shaky even though the weather forecast noted that there was no rain, thunderstorm or heavy winds to create such an effect. Most especially we missed our first flight to Brisbane because of the disorganisation of the service desk. We got there on time but because of how long the line was and the slow, insufficient operations of the people at the counter by the time we reached to check in our luggage the lady at the counter said we won’t make it for our flight, and the next flight would cause us to miss our connecting flight as well. This lady was extremely arrogant, rude, obstinate and unhelpful which is everything a person at the desk is supposed to be. We had to then pay for new flights and another connecting flight because of the ineptitude, chaos and disorganisation of the people at the ground service. This was also extremely risky as the flight we booked to Brisbane to connect to Port Moresby was in thirty minutes and we had to rush in checking our bass. Also they had only one person operating near the kiosk area as they all shut down, and the lines grew to be extremely long when we booked the new tickets. We asked a ground service person and they said it would take approximately 5hrs 30mins till the people from the back could reach the front. This was extremely rushed and a disappointing experience with Qantas who caused us to miss our flight. Also our returned flight from Port Moresby to Brisbane was delayed by 7 hours causing us to again miss our connecting flight to Sydney. Although they did compensate us for this incompetent mistake, we had to travel to Sydney the next day and stay over night in Brisbane which was inconvenient as I had morning plans to fulfil the next day we were supposed to arrive. For the previous mistake caused directly and consequently by the confusion, cluster and disorder of the Qantas ground service we were not compensated for. This is a clear example poor quality service and the way aircraft companies manipulate and scam people in terms of flight so they can cheat and inconvenience people so they can gain more money handed into their pockets. Qantas is a pathetic airline service and all positive connotations associated with the brand in terms of them being the safest and most efficient airline should be thrown in the trash.

Despite prefering to fly through the Middle East, I took this option which was available only to find that they do not update our mobiles on the flight delay. Originating flight from SYD was delayed by 2 hours hence the delay from SIN to LHR. Flight from KUL on MH was a breeze. Sadly, the boarding was a mess at SIN, flight delayed by 2 hours (left only at 1:30am from the original 11:30pm) which resulted in our arrival into LHR (Terminal 3) at close to 8am from the original 6am. Service was alright, nothing to shout about, seats on the A380 were huge and comfortable although the full flight did not help (one can feel the weight and the density) Meals were ok ex-SIN but not ex-LHR. Baggage did not arrive at KUL, one bag never left LHR and one more did not make it on the short connection to KUL. Bag arrived five days & one day later respectively. Check-in staff at LHR did not follow the procedure on the baggage tag when asked for help, she just pushed the bag onto the conveyor belt and that particular bag took 5 days after some probing; the staff responding to email was really helpful - thank you to the LHR team and MH for being so attentive in the delayed baggage.

"""abysmal Business Class flights""","Just abysmal Business Class flights. Even worse than obscure ordinary Chinese domestic airline service. A dreadful trip commenced with chaos and confusion because four Qantas flights, scheduled to leave at the same time, were allocated two adjoining departure gates. A thousand or so passengers were herded like sheep into a waiting area then down into ground level containment area where we were funnelled into lines and pushed onto hot crowded buses and then marched over the tarmac and then had to climb the stairs to board. The Sydney - J'Burg flight is 14 hours. We were given one meal immediately after take-off and a second meal one-hour before landing - this left a 12-hour gap between meals or snacks. This would have been easier to deal with if we were told meal times or had snacks available. The staff at the front galley disappeared for most of the flight. The staff, when we did see them were brusque, downright patronising and rude. The entertainment choices were very limited and appeared to the standard domestic route choices. The return flight left J'Burg 2 hours late which led to missed connections and an unnecessary overnight stay in Sydney. Sadly, a different crew on the return flight were just as abrupt and rude. Indeed, they just ""forgot"" to deliver meals and then almost tossed them at us when we enquired. It felt like both cabin crews resented being on this route and their general antipathy to the airline and/or their roster was reflected in their angry demeanour and consistently rude attitude to paying passengers. Irrespective of the reason, the poor attitude and terrible service is unacceptable in any circumstance.

Flights booked to travel from Sydney to Des Moines and less then 24 hours before the flight we receive a text message (not a phone call) to advise us that our flight was cancelled and Qantas would be in touch shortly with alterative flights. Well that was just a bald faced lie as we then received another text at 11:40pm tell us to that they had been trying to contact us (must of been by mental telepathy) and please ring this number to organise a refund or flight credits. Wanting neither of these things I rang the number and went through the process of entering Frequent flyer number etc' to verify myself to be finally connected to customer support. The agent had a very heavy accent and due to the noise was extremely difficult to understand, but that didn't seem to matter as 30 minutes into the call the call was terminated and I was returned to the automated system needing to re-enter my details. So I rang again only to get a different agent, again unable to hear and understand due to the noise and accent. So did I get my issue solved this time? No. Again 30 minutes into the call I was cut off. When I made a third call I requested at the start of the call to have the automated cut off turned off only to be told there was no such system, so I explained my last two calls and again insisted that the system be turned off to be told that this call would not be terminated at 30 minutes. When I first started talking to this service agent he told me the flight wasn't cancelled, so I had him recheck only to find out he was looking at the wrong day. So at 2am, the day I was due to fly I finally get flights rearranged. At the end of the conversation I enquired if any compensation was available for the stuffing around I had received only to be told that there was a form on the website I could fill out if I wanted to. Having had flights cancelled previously with other airline I had always been rung with apologies, alternative flights and offers of compensation, QANTAS offered none of this, had to ask for it all and yet to receive and apology. Flights organised I head off to the airport, no sleep, but the prospect of things to improve, wrong. Check-in was a joke, self serve, hundreds of people wanting to use a few machines that were working, poor staff, limited as they were, could not keep up with the issues. Finally got boarding passes and bag tags and headed to the self serve baggage drop only to find the machine would not read the boarding pass, so had to get the boarding pass re-printed and then guess what, the machine would not read the bag tag, so re-print required for this as well. Truly you can't make this up. While waiting for all this to happen, took over 90 minutes to get checked in and bag dropped we were watching people lining up at a service desk for so called budget airlines and being served by an attendant having their bags weighed and loaded and leaving with a smile and a boarding pass. So off to the plane and the chance for some sleep, nope. For some reason every other seat had a type of block under the frame of the seat in front blocking 1/3 of the available leg room so having both legs stretched out was impossible so had to have one leg tucked under the other for nearly 14 hours, So the food had to be good right? No. The plate of fresh seasonal fruit was a bag of dried rubber. Need I say more. Will never fly Qantas again.

"""service terrible for a premium cabin""","Where do I even begin. The flight was delayed 6 hours but Qantas did not inform us of any delay beforehand. The check-in agent did not mention anything, but there was a one-page printed letter at the check-in desk saying the flight has been delayed and that food vouchers would be provided. No vouchers were provided and when I presented the letter to the food outlets at JNB, none of them accepted it saying they had not been informed. Nice going Qantas. Luckily I have gold FF status with QF and we were able to use the Aspire lounge at JNB. The lounge itself is okay but this is not a review of the lounge, so I'll leave it there. When we finally got underway after the 6-hour delay, food was served. I was dozing off but the FAs did not even attempt to wake me up, and having had no dinner, I went to sleep. The service on board is terrible for a premium cabin. Pax were provided with one 500mL water bottle and none of the FAs even bothered to check on pax to see if anyone needed anything. Its as though they just shut shop after the dinner service. No food/snacks or even water was provided for over 8 hours. Breakfast was provided 2 hours before landing, and even that was mediocre. The tray table was left up on one of the middle seats and no one came to clear the table after dinner, the pax next to us had left his food on the tray and changed seats (see attached photo). Terribly disappointed with the service - the delay and the terrible service by FAs on board especially for a premium cabin/product.

"""do not deliver what they promise""","Qantas, “the pride of Australia, our National Carrier” they say. I say “shameful and not up to any Australian standard”. In comparison to other flights, Qantas surely lacks standards in terms of ground staff service, onboard meals, taking accountability and ensuring that no hiccups of any sort, is repeated. They should learn from their mistakes and value their patrons for without air passengers, Qantas cannot promote themselves. They surely need to upgrade their understanding of service. If one should go through the reviews of Qantas on several websites, one would read about delayed or cancelled flights, being unethical or uncaring when it comes to refunds or compensations, being unfair with costing when it comes to a change in original booking, declining quality, bad customer service, unreliable and do not deliver what they promise, woeful call centre delays, rude staff that take no liability for their mistakes, unpalatable onboard food, snobbish flight crew, lost baggage etc etc - just to name a few. My experience with Qantas was initially the onboard food, which was pathetic and unpalatable. Then, upon reaching my destination, I had the misfortune of “lost baggage” and thereafter learnt that the staff at Sydney Airport who assisted my 91 year old Mother-in-law and myself, did not produce any evidence for baggage claim once checked-in baggage were scanned and sent through on the conveyor belt. Soon after and the days that followed, I went on to experience staff at Call Centres based in Fiji, who were of no help whatsoever; Qantas Staff at Sydney Airport who refused to give out their names and who were utterly rude to my Sister who was following this case on my behalf whilst I was overseas; to a point of disconnecting her phone calls and refusing to pick up the phone again. All of my emails were automated responded, which became quite frustrating and there was not one phone call from Qantas-Australia (Sydney) that came through to me; to assure me that my baggage would be found instead of passing the buck; and finally after a month, Qantas has offered a meagre $300/- compensation when the contents of my baggage costed way more (although found and delivered after 72 hrs) but had to be discarded due to weather damage. I incurred additional expenses to have International roaming just to be readily available on call, should Qantas reach out to me; but, which never did happen. Travelling is stressful enough and to have your baggage lost is anxiety at its peak, especially when Qantas - Australia were of absolute no use and it was Staff at Bangalore Airport who were polished in their Services and who were empathetic, compassionate and understanding of my plight and did everything to keep me informed of their follow-up, on a daily basis. I boarded a direct 12 hr flight from Sydney to Bangalore, checking in 3 bags, in total. It was from point A to point B and yet, Qantas could not even get this right and had lost 1 baggage somewhere. After several phone calls, Qantas washed their hands and justified themselves stating that there was no record of 1 baggage and that only 2 was on the system. How then, when their ground staff were the ones to check all 3 bags, did one disappear off the records? The incompetence of Qantas Customer Care has been more like going through heavy turbulence and their reputation is nosediving as the worst performing Airline.

"""What an absolute nightmare""","What an absolute nightmare it is trying to deal with Qantas, so called ""Customer Service"" and ""Customer Care Specialists"". I have been a frequent flyer and Qantas Club member for 26 years and have never witness such a lack of customer service. I recently had to catch a Qantas domestic flight from Melbourne to Sydney to get an international flight with another airline. Our baggage was checked in at the designated Qantas counter for international connections and we were advised that our bags would be checked all the way to our final destination. Well, naturally this didn't happen and we had 5 people with no luggage for 3 days. One of the bags contained critical medications. I lodged a ""missed luggage report"" with the airline we were travelling on but they could not track where our baggage was. The following morning I contacted the local Qantas ""Customer Service"" only to be told that they could not assist in tracking our luggage. I continued to chase both Qantas and our other airline to try to locate our luggage with both denying responsibility. At least the other airline was able to tell me that the bags never made it to the connecting flight. After 3 days of living with out our luggage and me continuing to chase it, our luggage finally arrived with Qantas ""rush tags"" attached. When I returned home I sent an email to Qantas asking for an explanation for why our luggage didn't make the connecting flight, and why Qantas ""Customer Service"" didn't contact me to let me know that the bags wouldn't arrive. From that point on Qantas customer care specialist went into full deny mode and blame shifting to the other airline even though all evidence pointed to Qantas systems failing. There was no admission of any failure by Qantas and their ""Customer Care Specialist"" didn't even want to follow up to learn from the experience, just a hollow apology and a denial of any wrongdoing.",1,1,Stephen Brennan,2023-07-21,no,Economy Class,Business,Melbourne to Sydney,June 2023,1,1,1,1,1,Qantas Airways

It was just a simple request yet we are puzzled why customer service cant get this right with one call. Such a horrible experience and never want to fly this airline again. Not with this experience.

"""Qantas needs to honour their promise""","Appalling treatment and only made worse by their Customer Care Dept. I had booked and paid for 2 business class tickets in Dec 22 (using points plus pay). Boarding passes for myself and my sister were issued at luggage check-in. Upon arrival to business class lounge we were called up and told that only one of us could fly business, I requested to speak to a supervisor. The agent me several reasons, all unsatisfactory but apologised and assured me that the points and funds difference would be credited to my account. She further said by way of compensation she would offer me a $500 credit for the inconvenience. I enquired if this was to be cash, she said no it was a credit to be used towards flights only. She also subsequently met me at the gate before boarding and reiterated same. I was so distressed and affected by this bad start to my (special Christmas gift for my sister) holiday, that I ended up having to go to the hospital in Singapore. and I was very ill for the first 2 days of our 10 day trip All of which can be evidenced. I am not seeking compensation for this aspect but it should be known so that you have a complete picture of what occurred and the knock on effect. Since our return Qantas have shunted me from one department to another. First Customer Service (who apparently have no phone number), then Reservations Dept, then Frequent Flyer loyalty program. Each department tells me it is not under their purvue and that I need evidence of what the agent offered. I was told to go to the airport (a 4+ hour round trip for me) and to try to locate Karen at the airport. I explained that I would not be able to get to the business class lounge without a ticket and clearing customs - that Karen may not be working that day and that there may be many agents who work for Qantas. I was told I should have taken a reference number for the offer made by the agent. Well I did not realise I needed to make a recording or get an affidavit from her on the day as I took her at face value, assumed (and still do believe) that she made this offer in good faith and with full authority to do so. I am now told after wasting days /weeks on this that the complaint has been closed. I was not advised of this via email and no explanation given, they just decided to close it. Astonishing! Now when I make an enquiry I keep getting replies stating the reference number does not exist, presumably because they unilaterally decided to close it. Qantas needs to honour their promise and obligation. ie: 1. The correct amount of Frequent flyer loyalty points to be returned to my account (some points have been reinstated and then removed and I am querying the actual amount is correct). 2.

Once flight was boarded, doors locked, we were informed by the pilot that there were technical issues, so we cannot take off. Delayed on the tarmac for 3 hours 20 mins. My seat was right at the back, therefore could not use the overhead locker to store hand luggage as this is blocked off to passengers. The steward did not help me find space, even though I asked. Was told that I can just walk to the front and see if any available. My vegetarian meal was chick peas again. Thank goodness, my layover in Sydney was 4 hours 10 mins, so even though we were delayed in Johannesburg, I still caught my connecting flight to Auckland.

Before that we were just left hanging). We got no updates from any staff unless you made your way to the transit desk to ask. Even there the staff on duty had no idea what was going on. They kept promising we will be flying out by 18h00 that day. Staff, whether at transit desk or departure gates – abrupt, coarse, rude, patronizing, and talking down to people, like we are idiots.

"""I will never fly with Qantas again""","I booked tickets online with Qantas in February 2022. It was for myself, my husband and 4 children under the age of 10. For some reason, whilst booking, there was no option to select a child’s airfare. It was basically impossible to contact Qantas. I called and was on hold for over an hour and then got hung up on and another time was told by a recorded message to call back later and was disconnected. We needed to book our tickets so I booked them and continued to try contacting Qantas. Eventually, after being on hold for almost 2 hours I got through to someone. I explained the situation to them and they changed the booking to show that this was for 4 children. There was a difference in price so they said I would be refunded the difference. It could take up to 6 weeks for the money to go into my account so just wait. All seemed well. Our trip took place about 4 weeks later. I wasn’t all that impressed with Qantas when we flew but that’s another complaint. The 6 weeks came and went and I did not receive my refund. Once again I went through the process of calling Qantas and eventually got through to them. They said that because we had already flown we were not entitled to a refund. However, I had already been told we would get the refund before our trip so I didn’t understand how this was a problem. I was told to register a written complaint, which I did. Months later I still did not have an answer, so contacted them through email complaints department again. A few month later I received an email saying they were working on my claim. This went back and forth for a while. 2 weeks ago (well over a year since the original claim) I was told they regret my experience but they will not refund my money. They gave me some frequent flyer points which I don’t want because I will never fly with Qantas again. I truly believe they are in the wrong here. I was told I would get a refund and then the story changed after it was impossible for me to get the refund. This comes to like $400, which is a lot of money to me. Also, just as a general thing. We have flown with a few other airlines since then (we are doing humanitarian aid-type work in Thailand -which is why we were flying when Covid was still an issue) and every other airline has been just as good, if not better, than Qantas -including the cheaper ones. This goes for domestic and international so I would advise anyone to not fly with Qantas, even if they have a good deal. They are not any better than anyone else and if you have an issue it’s near impossible to work out. We don’t get paid for the work we do so any money we have is very needed.

"""ever increasing delays at Qantas""","Despite the aircraft arriving from Hong Kong 5 hours before the flight to Singapore, boarding was delayed by 1 hour in Sydney. Gate staff continuously blamed other factors such as cleaning staff taking longer than required or no gate available as reasons for the delay. When questioned on boarding as to why the plane couldn’t be cleaned in the preceding 5 hours, I was simply told to email customer care, which seems to be the go to response for most Qantas ground staff these days when confronted with polite complaints about the ever increasing delays at Qantas. Cabin crew were pleasant and helpful and the economy class supervisor was amazing, as she singled my family out for special attention and care. This had more to do with my frequent flyer status rather than just being a passenger receiving great service. Aircraft was 19 years old and showing its age. Broken fittings on the seats and in the toilets, ripped seat covers and damaged wall panels, the plane had clearly seen better days. Seats are narrow and leg room and recline are minimal compared to the likes of other major airlines. Food was inedible, bland and prison canteen style. Qantas have dispensed with trays containing an assortment of items and metal cutlery is no longer. You now just get a small portioned bowl with foil on top and a piece of bread slapped on the foil and some wooden cutlery in an envelope. Silver lining is that it’s easy to slip the bowl on the floor under your seat when you decide not to eat anything.

"""We are so disappointed""","On 11 September 2022, I booked flights to Bali for myself and my partner using my Qantas Frequent Flyer Points – I was given a booking confirmation and reservation number  for Jetstar flight departing 12 May 2023. On 7 February 2023, I received an email from Qantas advising of an updated departure to our flights which I had to accept online which I did. The day prior to our flight we checked our Qantas App, which was showing the flights with no further changes, we were unable to check in on line as it was a Jetstar flight which we were aware of. The morning of our flight, we arrived early at the Jetstar check in, whilst checking in we were advised by the Jetstar staff that we owed $1050 for our flights. Clearly very confused we showed them our booking reference and our Qantas App which the flights were clearly there. We were informed by Jetstar that this was a Qantas issue, that we would need to speak with Qantas but at 4am no one from Qantas was around and that if we wanted to get on that flight, we would need to pay the $1050! As I was flying to Bali to meet my entire family for my 50th Birthday, we had no choice but to use the money we had saved for the holiday and pay the fare. When the Qantas lounge opened, I went to speak with a staff member on the service desk, they could clearly see the booking and let me take a screen shot they were unable to explain what had happened and told me to phone the customer service line when I got back to Australia. Upon returning from Bali, I attempted to phone the Qantas Customer Service line, after 2 hours on hold my call was answered and I was advised that I needed to lodge the claim online. I did this and a week later received a two line email saying that no ticket was issued and apologised for the inconvenience but no refund would be provided. I do not know how you can get a booking reference, emails advising of updates to flights and to accept them to then be told you owe $1050.

While posting billions in post pandemic profits I wanted to share what my recent experience of a Qantas flight looks like from a customer perspective. But firstly on a positive note thank you Qantas my luggage and I arrived on time and safely in Brisbane always a plus but that’s where any positive news ends. The seats are amongst the narrowest I’ve seen and unfortunately the seat in front of me appears to have been broken resulting in the passenger in front spending the entirety of the trip virtually sleeping in my lap to the extent that I had to tilt the screen to continue watching the inflight entertainment which is outdated and limited in choice compared to carriers such as Emirates and Qatar. The food service was a laughing stock, who serves a paddle pop and a Lindor ball and considers that as appropriate anywhere but a 5 year olds birthday party this was on the flight to Singapore. After the food service there was no drink service as the crew ensconced themselves at the rear of the plane with the curtain drawn making it feel intrusive to seek out a water after a limbo dance to extract yourself from the passenger in fronts reclined seat. An hour before landing passengers were served a pastry that resembled something you would find 3 days down the track in the pie Beaumaris at 7/11. This was the final leg on my trip from Europe so my welcome back home flight which was purchased on codeshare on an Airfrance booking after I was unable to use a 1k Qantas flight credit from a cancelled US flight from 2020. The quote from QANTAS for a return flight to Paris economy using the flight credit was 8k solo and I have now waited 3 years for my flight refund it seems ironic that I ended up on this codeshare flight when I was not able to book an equivalent flight with Qantas direct Avoid this airline at all costs",1,3,A Neale,2023-05-30,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,Singapore to Brisbane,May 2023,1,1,3,3,2,Qantas Airways
"""a complete shortage of meals""","Qantas was disappointing. It is considered a top airline, but my first experience with them on a Brisbane to Los Angeles trip was underwhelming. The plane was old and lacked adapters for charging devices, with only one USB port. Additionally, the entertainment options were limited. When requesting a drink, the crew would often bring just a can without a cup or ice, which was inconvenient. The dinner consisted of lamb with mashed potatoes, but the meat was chewy and the taste was unpleasant. The meal lacked accompanying items like bread, butter, salad, or dessert. For breakfast, served an hour before landing, the crew informed the last three rows that hot meals had run out, offering only granola and yogurt instead. This was surprising and not ideal, as I have never encountered a complete shortage of meals on a flight before.

"""Never fly with them!""","The worst experience withMy friends and I were booking flights to Perth. We had booked a one-way flight for $350 and the next day we saw a Qantas deal for $175 each way if you were paying return. My friend called Qantas if we could cancel that flight and book under the deal. They said we will give you a credit for your flight and you can book the deal with the credit but we had to do it online. We attempted to do so and it said we would have to call to apply for the credit. The next person we spoke to said no you can't use the credit for this. They then said they would honour it after multiple phone calls of multiple employees telling us very different things and never being able to get a straight answer. My return flight became a separate booking as I was returning to Adelaide a day sooner so I had to call separately. At one point I had agreed to pay a gap of $40 to change the flights and asked to confirm that I would not be charged a full new fair they said yes only $40 and then hung up on me and proceeded to take $350 out of my bank account with no permission. They then said they would honour it after multiple phone calls from multiple employees telling us very different things and never being able to get a straight answer. We all had the flights confirmed in the Qantas app and it said the credit was in our accounts. I never received any information to say I owed additional money, no emails, no calls and nothing in my online account or app. We were able to check in to the airport using the app for our flight into Perth and had no issues. When I was in Perth, I attempted to check in for my return flight to which it said I was checked in but would have to collect a boarding pass from the service desk at the airport. I called to see if there were any issues. It was at this point while I was in another state that they proceeded to tell me that I had to pay another $309 to get home. I said that is not accurate but they refused to help so I went to the airport the following day to hopefully speak to someone in person. The lady at the desk provided me with another terrible experience saying she could do nothing and I would have to call the reservations line again to sort it out. I said the flight leaves in an hour and it takes 40 minutes of being on hold before I can get through so she after making a big fuss called them herself. The whole time she mocked me to who she was on the phone with directly in front of me. When I showed them the deal I booked and gave them the booking code that I had been provided they refused and said it wasn't valid. They said just because it said 'confirmed' in my app meant that I had a booking but I had to now pay for a ticket. I said if you listen to the recordings of the conversation you can hear them say they would honour the deal and it was all sorted, they then said no this will have been deleted now and the notes say something different. I said I had no additional funds to pay for a ticket to get home because their company told me the deal would be honoured. They refused and boarding was closing in 5 minutes so I was forced to borrow money from a family member to pay for the ticket. I asked for her full name which she refused. I asked for the name of the person on the phone and she said 'no I can't remember' despite using it multiple times in the call and seemed to know them very well.

With the seats in the fully reclined position, which was most of the time on these overnight flights, it was very difficult to get in and out of your seat.

"""worst customer service communication""","The worst airline to exist. We were supposed to fly Tokyo to Auckland via Sydney on a Friday night at 10pm. There were a lot of things wrong about our flight. When the online check-in opened, their system only checked in one of the two passengers for the Sydney to Auckland flight. Their system said “Check in at Airport” - which was fine. Five hours before the flight, they sent a message that our flight has been cancelled. One hour later, they retracted and said your flight is not cancelled. When I reached the airport, the staff tried to check me in for the Sydney to Auckland flight but their system won’t let her. They advised that I should just check in with the staff upon reaching Sydney. After the staff gave us our boarding ticket, they advised that the aircraft need to refuel in Brisbane, so the aircraft will make a stop, refuel, we don’t need to get out of the aircraft, before flying to Sydney. Mid-flight, the pilot announced we are terminating in Brisbane and that we need to pick up our luggage even if we have onward flight. Now the problem here is that we don’t have a landing permit to enter Australia. When we got to Brisbane, we told the ground crew our situation and she assured us that she will “personally” pick up our luggage and retag it herself (her exact words). She told us that they are working on rebooking us and that we should just wait at the gate. When we got to the gate, since there were no Qantas flights yet, there weren’t any staff around. I tried to check with the staff in Business Lounge about our boarding pass. She found out that I am still not checked in and also they cannot find our luggage. A few minutes before our boarding time, the staff for the boarding gate finally arrived. She was able to check me in but they still cannot locate our luggage. She raised a ticket for us and said, just see if your luggage might reach Auckland once you get there. When we reached Auckland, to no surprise at all, our luggage wasn’t there. We were travelling domestically across other parts of New Zealand so we asked to send to our hotel where we were staying the longest. We had to buy clothes for a few days to prepare for the worst. I called up the airline baggage services in Australia, Japan and Auckland - either no one picks up or they ask me to call another office or just apologize. We stayed for a week in New Zealand and no news from Qantas. On the day before we fly back to Tokyo, Auckland’s lost luggage staff called us and told us that they have our luggage. When we picked up the luggage from the office, it’s been sitting in Auckland the whole time since the day after we arrived in the city. Bag was retagged but Qantas didn’t bother to update their system for easy tracking?! Now in the present day, they earlier told us they will compensate but later on another customer service staff is saying they will not. Clearly something wrong with their communication even internally. Anyway, long story short - worst airline, worst customer service communication, and thanks to them Qantas they ruined our first visit to Oceania.

"""worst airline I have ever flown with""","Honestly the worst airline I have ever flown with. Starting when they booked me on a Comair flight in August 2022 when the company was liquidated in May 2022. Then I missed all of my connecting flights because there were no flights out of Cape town to Johannesburg. After waiting 2 hours to get the issue sorted out I was eventually booked onto another flight the following day. While changing my flights they just decided to change my return flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town. I initially had a 2 hour layover now I have a 6hour layover. Didn’t ask me if the could nor did they inform me they had changed it. Seats are so small and uncomfortable, the one staff member on the flight from Sydney was so rude. The entertainment is very average. Overall I would just never recommend them to anyone. Nor will I fly with them again.",1,1,Luane Van Niekerk,2023-01-01,no,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,Cape town to Auckland via Sydney,January 2023,1,4,1,3,1,Qantas Airways
"""never been treated with such disrespect""","I want to talk about service in business class aboard Flight QF 24 that left Bangkok to Sydney, Australia on Dec 26th 2022. My boyfriend and I travel very often, and ALWAYS get business class seats for not just the comfortable seating but most importantly the service and respect. This has been present in every flight we have ever taken, besides this one. We boarded the plane and everything was lovely; seats were nicely prepared and comfortable. We sat and got settled in when one of the staff came around with the normal complimentary champagne which was greatly appreciated. We even asked for a second glass before take off, and were given it no problem at all. Once the flight took off, we were waiting for the normal first class flight attendants to come around and refresh our beverages. We got nothing, only eyes gearing the other way from our seats while we were trying to get the attention from one of the three attendants servicing our area. So, we decided to wait patiently for an hour and a half from take-off when they came around asking what we would like for dinner. My boyfriend and I both asked our separate flight attendants for a refresher, which we were then told we had to wait till after dinner was served (Never have we ever been told no, or ""wait"" in first class) again, one of the reasons we chose to spend thousands on these special seats. Finally we got our second drink after 2 hours had passed at this point. I asked for a glass or champagne and wine, and was told by a male flight attendant, ""you can only have one"" while my boyfriend sat with two glasses next to me, and also before take-off we were given two glasses of champagne? That made no sense and felt extremely weird energy from the staff after this. He then came back and asked if I'd like that second drink now, and I responded “yes please” remaining respectful and grateful. As he comes back for the third time about 20-30 minutes after the second glass was poured, he offers me another drink, but throws in “would you like to start with a glass of water first?” I felt very uncomfortable that he offered me water, without me asking for it, and awkwardly accepted the water. I have never in my 8 years of flying business/first class been asked a question like he did, especially when I was completely reserved and respectful, not one bit out of character. And after he had said/acted this way towards me, the flight attendant that was servicing my boyfriend was approaching him to ask him if he'd like another drink as well. The staff quickly walked to the other side and whispered something in that employee's ear while he was in the middle of pouring my boyfriend a drink, and again, that flight attendant asked him “would you like a glass of water to start with?”. My boyfriend firmly said “No, I would not” as he was officially picking up on the disrespect and completely uncalled for attitude towards both of us. We both became extremely irritated and felt very welcomed and disrespected. We have flown on countless airlines, business/first class seats, and like I said earlier, have NEVER been treated with such disrespect and immatureness from first class flight attendants. We are both successful people and enjoy being treated with respect wherever we go, which is why, like I said, we spend our hard earned money to get that same treatment.",0,1,Kendall Wright,2022-12-29,no,Business Class,Couple Leisure,Bangkok to Sydney,December 2022,4,4,2,1,1,Qantas Airways

"""Worst flight with Qantas""","Worst flight with Qantas. We used to fly Qantas quite often to Australia before covid, but my friends and I have had a terrible experience with Qantas on a recent trip to Bali. Our flight went via Sydney, which was delayed for an hour, by the time we made it to Sydney, we had to sprint to get to our connecting flight to Bali, our friends were told that there baggage had to be collected in Sydney to then be checked in for the flight to Bali - which made no sense, as it was an international transit. So half of us made it to the gate just in time, where we were met with rude staff, who blamed us for not telling our friends that they should have come straight to the gate as their bags were already loaded on the aircraft along with ours - but we didn’t want to go against what they had been told. So our friends missed the flight! To top things off, our baggage was not on the flight, even though the staff at the gate told us everyone’s baggage was on the flight. So we spent the first 3 days of our trip in Bali with no clothes to do the activities we wanted to do, our friends arrived a day late (they were not put up in a hotel by qantas, they had to buy a room themselves) and we were only compensated $60NZD which got us either a cheap shirt and shorts or bikinis for 3 days.

We waited for over an hour after we were due to take off and were finally given an update that we can't board this plane with no reason given. We were told Qantas is flying up a new plane and it would arrive by just after 9pm. No surprises this was a lie. They organised external catering as the one kiosk had already closed, which was frozen sandwiches .. yes still completely frozen. We then waited with no further reasoning as to why we can't board this plane. I had to exit the airport to use any bathroom facilities. Whilst out there I was near the fence and tried to say hello to one of the original pilots. He looked at me like I was a nobody, turned his back and walked away. We finally got the new plane at 10:20pm and departed Paraburdoo 5 hours late. Not even an apology from the captain, cabin crew or any Qantas employee. We departed at 11:pm and arrived in Perth just after 12:30am.

"""customer service is truly deplorable""","Qantas customer service is truly deplorable these days. I had a flight booked from Singapore to Australia that was 100% cancellable and refundable with no penalty to be applied. I paid extra for this privilege of having the ticket being fully refundable. I cancelled the flight online and received no confirmation email or other acknowledgement, it simply disappeared from my frequent flyer account. After waiting 3 weeks with no update and no refund, I called customer service to be told that there had been a mistake on Qantas' side meaning that the refund hadn't been processed, that they would do this manually now and that I would have to wait 8 weeks for the money to appear. 8 weeks to process a refund that is fully payable as a term of the ticket is insane and to make me wait 3 extra weeks for a total of 11 weeks because of a mistake made by Qantas boggles the mind. As a comparison, on the same day that I cancelled my Qantas flight, I cancelled a hotel booking on a booking site that was actually for a larger total sum than the Qantas flight. That money from the hotel booking site appeared as a credit on my AMEX card 72 hours later.

Qantas of course, after I waited an hour on the phone, said that they were not responsible and couldn't do anything.

"""permanently put off flying them""","Flew QF1 Sydney to London on 7 October on one of Qantas’ A380s and the flight was an absolute disaster. It all started as I sat in the lounge and slowly the notifications started to drop through. The flight time was at first delayed half an hour but by the time I actually arrived in London the flight had been delayed nearly four hours. It turns out that I got off lucky as other QF1 flights this month have been delayed by five hours and nearly six hours. Already you can see that this flight’s performance is absolutely pathetic and you cannot depend on Qantas to get you to arrive on time. The delay caused me great anxiety and prevented me from being able to sleep on the plane for the whole flight. I belatedly arrived in London an absolute mess. Qantas have really cheapened their food offerings. They no longer provide a traditional meal service. They give you a main dish and a piece of bread but without any other accompanying dishes. The main I chose was roast beef and mash with a tasteless piece of bread. There was no dessert offered at the time but they later came round with an ice cream that is clearly marketed at children. I’m not sure why they think that it counts as a proper dessert. The most frustrating parts of the flights was the constant delays. Delayed take off, delayed clearance to land, delayed clearance to taxi to the gate. Delayed receiving my bag at Heathrow. This happened at almost every part of the flight which only increased the overall delay. The most insulting part was when the captain apologised for the flight “being a bit late” Many people including me missed their connections and others would have had to book new flights due to travelling on separate tickets. I had to book a new flight to Barcelona as I should have had eight hours to travel from Heathrow to Gatwick and catch another flight but due to the significant delay I was unable to make it on time. Qantas in its current state should be avoided at all cost. I have been permanently put off flying them and would recommend to all reading this that you also avoid flying them. Their logistical issues caused by Alan Joyce gutting the airline during the pandemic have killed this airline. The downgrading of the inflight service is just insulting to customers.

"""would not fly again with Qantas Internationally""","They are cutting services, food, amenities, I am an economy only traveller so this review is based on experience flying international in economy class. I travel Australia to India mostly with Singapore and Thai and this time gave Qantas a try on the return from Delhi to Melbourne. Review is based on my past experience with Thai and Singapore Airlines. I booked via agent. Basics good - flight onboarding, general courtesy of flight attendants was good so 3 stars. This was a 12hr plus direct flight 8pm DEL - 13.55 MEL. Food: Average at best. Very small portions and pretty much tasteless. Can't call it sambhar when it looks and taste like pumpkin. We were 4 passengers and had different meals which were all tasteless. Food service: For a flight starting at 8pm (DEL) and landed at 2pm (Melbourne) they served 2 main meals only. Dinner served at 10.30pm (2.5hrs into flight) and Breakfast served around 1pm (Melbourne). Kids were hungry and had to request breakfast for which we got some soy crackers while actual breakfast was served at lunch time! They kept on serving snack items - soy crackers, chocolate etc in between but skipped on one full meal. Amenities: They did not have Toothpaste and Toothbrush for a flight originating at dinner time and ending at lunch time. Upon asking flight attendants took the feedback and said its not provided on this flight and that generally its provided for long flights. I was surprised if almost a 13 hour direct flight isn't a long flight to have toothpaste etc on board. No warm/hot napkin etc to freshen up. Old style armrests which have press to call attendants button which we all pressed accidentally by resting elbows on armrests. It could be just the DEL-MEL leg and not in general Qantas planes for other international legs but hey that's what I got and experienced. For my mediocre experience with food, food service, basic amenities I'd give it 3 stars and would not fly again with Qantas Internationally. I got much better experience with Thai, Singapore and Emirates for the same legs of journey at same price levels and would avoid Qantas under normal conditions of travel.",1,5,N Reddy,2022-10-05,no,Economy Class,Family Leisure,New Delhi to Melbourne,October 2022,4,1,3,2,1,Qantas Airways
"""How low grade has this airline become""","QF119 on September 2, 2022 / Seat 4K. The catering on this flight was disgraceful, for fares costing $1000 plus there is no printed menus (lets not blame Covid), no choice of meal and one piece of bread per passenger, in business class. I was verbally advised there is “one piece of bread loaded per business class passenger sir”. So, with zero choice of meals as I dont eat the Indian meal that what was offered, butter chicken, which smelt awful permeating through the cabin, I ate the small plate of lettuce leaves and once slice of bread. Business class? How very tragic. I then asked for a plate of cheese, once available in Business class on Qantas both domestically and internationally, and is now another bygone luxury. Once again, “sorry, no cheese loaded” says the attendant. The pre packaged dry cake they called 'dessert' in business class on this international flight was also left on my tray uneaten. Eventually the cabin crew presented me with a bag of Santos pretzels, the dregs from the economy snack tray. How low grade has this airline become? There are many far superior options to get to Auckland from Australia. Qantas just do not care about you, your hard earned money or their food, all they care about is their bottom line.

Apart from a broken table in seat 23A the outward leg was fine good food, good service good everything that is where the similarity ends. The return leg on Saturday the 17 Sept Flight QF10 could not have been so different. We were called to board and I went to the boarding gate along with my partner and other Premium Econ passenger. At the gate i was told I wasn't wants. I explained we had been called and was told ""Yes but not you"" we were directed to go stand in a corner with two other passengers, our passports and boarding passes were taken from us by an individual who did nothing with them. Shortly thereafter the Qantas duty manager appeared and spoke with one of the other passengers that were cast aside, The passenger was advised her Premium Economy seat was inoperable and could not be reclined, she was offered the option of a $500 USD credit, or a re book in a weeks time. We were then spoken to and the issue was the same an inoperable seat same offer $500USD or wait a week. The refund was made while arguing with Qantas the manager was only interested in missing the slot. We were advised the Purser would come speak with us, he didn't. For 17 hours my partner endured the privilege of sitting in a seat that did not recline therefore could not sleep. Of the 28 seats in Premium Economy 3 were inoperable. We had a vacant seat beside us. We did not receive the welcome drink that might have cooled tempers then there was the meal issue, 3 options were stated on the menu, the vegetarian option wasn't available at all, by the time that had served the first few rows the 2nd option a Vietnamese Chicken salad was gone, we were advised they only loaded 6 of these for Premium Economy that left us with the only remaining dish a very tied overcooked grayish beef stew. If Neil Perry put his signature to these dishes for Qantas then he hasn't trialled them in a longtime. The food was disgusting so much so I passed on breakfast. Back to the broken seat as there was a vacant seat in the row I opted to move into it so that my partner had the benefit of a reclining seat.

"""In short, the service is diabolical""","Qantas Airways has drastically diminished in service since COVID. I flew return in business class to Singapore and there many disappointments along the way: 1) My luggage did not arrive in Singapore. I checked in well ahead of time and my bag had ironically been tagged as first as the desk had run out of business tags. Qantas does not have any service on the ground and relies upon Singapore Airlines in case of lost luggage. I registered the missing bag at the airport, but it proved impossible to get through on the phone to follow up. The website simply stated they were attempting to locate my bag. And it was impossible to gain any compensation. As it turned out my luggage never arrived - it appeared several hours after my return to London, so it would seem it never left LHR and there was no attempt to deliver it to me in Singapore. It was impossible to get any information on compensation and I am still waiting for that. I contacted Qantas via web form, and social media (and attempted via phone). I also attempted to get information on compensation and registered a complaint at check in on my return and at the lounge. The service is appalling. I have received an email from Qantas stating they have tried to get in touch, which is not true, and I attempted to respond and included my reference number but received an auto-reply stating there was no reference number. In short, the service is diabolical. 2) The food / inflight service: No pre-dinner drink/snack and no entrée. For a 13 hour flight and business class ticket at a cost of around £7000 the service is lower than many short haul economy. The main was served on a side plate. I had a glass of wine, and chose cheese for dessert which was served on what appeared to be a saucer! 3) The toilets in half of the plane were broken: The staff advised because half of the toilets were not working they would only serve water for the flight. This seemed very perplexing and it was perhaps that they hadn't stocked drinks. There was no offer of compensation for lack of drinks and as mentioned the drink service seemed very limited from the time of boarding, rather than after a few hours in when the staff said the toilets broke. 4) Running low on fuel: As we came closer to LHR on the return leg, the captain announced that they were running low on fuel and we would divert to Birmingham (which is further north). Again this caused a great deal of confusion. The explanation was something to do with weather, however, by this stage confidence in the airline had disappeared. A short time later the ""fuel crisis"" had somehow been averted and we landed at LHR. Overall a terrible experience and I am still awaiting advice on compensation a number of weeks later and out of pocket having to buy clothes and personal items for a week in Singapore without luggage. I also had to attend my first day in the office in my clothing from the flight. The attitude of Qantas towards business passengers (and no doubt all passengers) is appalling.

Due to the shortness of the flight (50 minutes), only a very simple snack (crackers and cheese) and a beverage service were provided which, although simple is still a step up from the offerings of Virgin and Jetstar offering nothing for free. However, its high price (about 50% more expensive than Virgin and Jetstar) negates some of the advantages Qantas has in its offerings and therefore makes it suitable more for time-sensitive business travelers over price-sensitive leisure travelers.

His flight was delayed twice, then he was advised whilst still in Sydney after Qantas had to put him up for a night that his case had been misplaced & he’d have to see if it turned up at the London end. It didn’t, he was told to do a report, which he did and they would keep him up to date on where his luggage was, didn’t happen. The luggage company have terrible reviews, so out of concern he contacted Qantas to find out where his case is, they didn’t know. This is 2 days on.

The new seats reclined fully with ample room for taller people and are both supportive and fully adjustable so make for a great range of sitting, reclining or sleeping flat. I am glad I took my thick woolly jumper as I do find airplanes a little colder that comfortable - but that is a matter of choice and easily fixed by wearing appropriate clothing. The Steward hung my jacket in the wardrobe upon first settling to the seat and offered a glass of champagne, The various meals that followed were delicious and on-demand service friendly and punctual. The ICE worked smoothly with little lag but I do prefer my own book, a cozy blanket and maybe tea; maybe coffee; maybe a single malt. All was arranged with a smile and promptly. Sleep was easy with the adaptive lighting in the cabin and during the night it was very easy to call for any extra service. Toilets at the rear of the Business Class Cabin were always clean but so tiny that the reason for being their required some dexterity.

"""stressful experience with mediocre service""","After flying with the competition for the last couple of years, I decided to give Qantas another go. The result is that I’ll avoid making further bookings unless necessary. Since the pandemic, Qantas appears to be an airline in disarray and certainly not what it used to be. I had an unpleasant experience on a recent flight from Brisbane to Melbourne, where my flight was cancelled and as a result I was delayed by almost 4 hours. This wasn’t bad considering some of the other passengers on board were rebooked on a flight that was 7 hours later. However, it still meant that I was very late to my own birthday dinner. A lot of Qantas staff appear to be disgruntled which has an effect on customer service. This doesn’t seem surprising given media reports on how they were treated over the course of the pandemic. When I approached a check in counter at Melbourne airport, the staff member, without saying a word, put a sign in front of my face, with a message to the effect: “counter closed, please be considerate to our staff”. The inflight meal service seems to be the main differentiator from the competition. However, on domestic flights this is minimal and doesn’t come remotely close to justifying the higher ticket prices. Due to the delay, the flight operated well within the timeframe for complimentary beer and wine however, this was not provided as they were basing their service off the original scheduled departure time. Luggage collection in Brisbane was a mess. Hundreds of people crowding around the conveyor that would maybe spit out 1 suitcase per minute. The wait was in excess of 30 minutes. Overall, I found my flight to be a stressful experience with mediocre service and onboard offering.",1,1,C Mayle,2022-08-17,no,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,Melbourne to Brisbane,August 2022,2,1,1,3,1,Qantas Airways

It took 15-20 hrs on phone calls trying to use credit vouchers I had accumulated over covid. I didn’t know at the time, but my ticket was never correctly issued until the day before my flight when Qantas rang me in a panic trying to say I hadn’t paid! After another 4 hr conversation and it was agreed that I had credit vouchers. Anyway, my tickets were expensive and supposedly very flexible. On my returning flight home I wanted to pay for an upgrade as my wife became pregnant whilst we were away for many months. I then spent 5-7 hrs on the phone with Qantas on various different conversations, which were all handled completely differently. All I wanted was to upgrade my flight and pay for it. How hard can this be? My request was never granted and I was told that it would be possible 24th before the flight and that Qantas’s would contact me. I also ring emirates and after only 5-10mins they said to me that because Qantas ‘owns’ the ticket they cannot change it. I then arrive at the airport after never received my upgrade offer. I spend 4-5 hrs at the airport trying to pay for an upgrade to this flight. Emirates senior staff also rang Qantas on my behalf and demanded it to be possible as there were seats available, but Qantas still refused for whatever reason. Anyway, emirates may still upgrade us at a cost but only once we get on the plane first and only if seats remain available. They said if we booked though emirates they would only charge us a small fee to upgrade, but because it is a Qantas ticket they are limited with options.

Which cannot be said for QF management: shortly after QF82 touched down in Sydney, QF2 (also from Singapore) also landed in Sydney (as noticed by myself when taxing to the gate). QF82 passengers then waited for their luggage, as did QF2 passengers. After an hour QF82 passengers were advised that their baggage will be delayed because of 'a lack of staff and equipment"". However, it then got to be known the QF Chief Executive Alan Joyce was on board of QF2 and got his luggage delivered prior to any other passengers. In other words, QF82 passengers had to wait for their luggage (although arriving earlier than QF2) for another half and hour (a total of 1.5 hours) to enable Mr Joyce's (and QF2's) luggage to be delivered first. Well, it seems that the customer is no longer king.

They said we needed to get Australian e-Visas and that we had 20 minutes to sign up for and receive approval or they would not take our bags or issue boarding passes. Our three young kids began crying. The agents even tried to shame us by claiming we didn't properly prepare for our trip - like it was our fault. The reason there is no information about visa requirements for transit passengers is that there is no such requirement. Qantas agents put us through absolute hell and pain for no reason. We managed to get the unneeded visas after 30 minutes of misery. To add insult to injury, they didn't honor the window seat selections I had paid for two days prior. They instead put us in the very back of the plane in the middle. The agent said ""You weren't charged."" An absolute lie. Qantas did charge us! Two out-of-five of our seats had faulty and inoperable AVOD on the a380 from LAX-SYD. Lastly, Qantas lost our checked luggage. We arrived in Bali with nothing. It took us 11 days to finally get it.

I was all ready for the flight making  sure that I had all the required documentation including Covid vaccine certificate, baggage properly weighed, destination country's covid requirement document (air suvidha). As soon as I arrived at the desk, the lady asked me if I had purchased additional baggage, I said that I had already checked the weights 4 times and I have less weight than what I am allowed. She took around 15 minutes to verify the covid vaccination certificate and the air suvidha form (destination country requirement) I literally had to show her the first and last vaccine dates on the printed certificate. Then she took another 15 minutes to search/look up our itinerary saying that its not showing on her computer so I had to literary show her the booking reference number and the name format on the itinerary. Another 15 minutes to check the baggage allowance, asking me if i knew how much I was allowed to which I answered and even provided my printed copy of the itinerary, she was visiting the Srilankan Airlines website to find out the allowance. The lady serving us had to call her colleague to assist her. Finally after more than 45 minutes I was issued with boarding pass but this didn't end here. She issued us boarding pass only from HBA to SYD but not the other two boarding pass. Upon enquiring she said she could only issue from HBA to SYD and advised me to go to Sydney and collect other boarding pass from there. When I asked about the transfer from domestic airport to international she replied saying that I need to take a bus or train which will cost around $6 per person to get transferred. I told her that we have not chosen self transfer and paid more so that everything was smooth as I had young family with me, she said me that she doesn't know about that and that I would require a future Qantas boarding pass to get on the bus.  As the flight was delayed, Qantas failed to provide the information to the other staff on duty at receiving airport nor to the partner airline (SriLankan). The Srilankan airline almost left us because Qantas flight was delayed, luckily we could catch the flight as the staff at Srilankan airline delayed the flight for us. I am very disappointed by the behaviour and the customer service of the staff at HBA. Qantas being a reputed company my expectation were high but it was no where close to it in terms of the desk staff.

"""constant delays and zero service""","QF93 Melbourne to Los Angeles, constant delays and zero service from any staff. After several hours of trying to check-in, I finally made my way to the departure gate. Despite extensive delays in boarding, no announcement was ever made, and staff seemed content on setting up little poles and ropes here and there, with no indication as to why. Seated about an hour late (no communications, queries just greeted with shoulder shrugs), the first announcement I heard for the day was ""the plane has a flat tyre, it'll take 45 minutes to fix it"". After about 90 minutes, a clearly irritated captain came on and announced ""due to Qantas policy of outsourcing its maintenance crew, we have been advised the crew that changed the tyre are not qualified to drive the jeep that pushes the plane onto the runway. We have called a bloke who may know what to do, and he will be here in about another hour"". Ultimately we left 4.5 hours late, crummy meal accompanied by sullen to rude inflight service, we arrived at LAX 4 hours late (the captain congratulating himself on making up 30 minutes inflight). Missed connections for 75% of the passengers, and a dubious pre-landing announcement advised there will be Qantas ground staff available to assist with re-bookings. Needless to say, there was no one. Left to our own devices, I was able to get on the last Southwest flight, at additional expense, to my destination (my previously booked AA flight already had departed an hour earlier.) The elderly couple who had been sitting next to me looked mortified at the prospect of sleeping on the airport floor until the next flight to Maryland. They texted me at 4 am on the day of my return flight to advise me they had cancelled my Los Angeles to Melbourne flight (operational reasons!) Nothing else, just ""cancelled"" No information, no updates, no emails, nothing. After the usual ridiculous wait times to a non-comprehending call centre operator, I was able to organise a return to Melbourne via Sydney. Of course, it was late and only a combination of carry-on luggage, high-speed sprinting and commando rolls into the domestic terminal enabled me to make the flight home.  The boarding pass I had been given didn't scan, so the gate attendant sneered at me with ""boarding denied, stand aside please"" as her only comment. Fortunately, a Qantas employee was on hand and showed her how to scan a barcode. Clearly irritated, she grunted at me and pointed towards the entry door.

Ground communication in relation to boarding was sub par. While I had ""special meals"", the amount of people in the premium economy cabin having to take the last dish on offer was atrocious. They ran out of apple juice in breakfast service. You can clearly tell where upper management has cut back budget, a pity given the price premium travelers pay. However, the worst part of the trip was the fact our plane was delayed for ""cleaning"", but given the state of the aircraft, I'd hazard a guess no cleaning had been done. There was mess everywhere around my seat, an empty bag of chips discarded on the ground that had been left there, a seat and tray table that hadn't been sanitised. Just horrible!

My longest wait so far has been 4 hours 37 minutes and 23 seconds .. unbelievable, and so I eventually gave up and put the phone down! The Qantas organisation, if it can be called that, is an absolute disgrace! My Voucher / Credit is worth $837.86 and I simply cant use it until somebody answers the phone and works out what the problem is! All I receive when I input my Credit Voucher reference and Name is ... 'ERROR, WE ARE UNABLE TO FIND THIS BOOKING CONFIRMATION'. My Frequent Flyer Account says the value of the Credit is exactly half of the above ($419.83) because it only takes into account my original ticket, and not my Fiancées original ticket, but even this 50% Credit will not load properly? Once again I get 'ERROR, WE ARE UNABLE TO FIND THIS BOOKING' Finally, today a Lady in the Philippines picked up the phone after another 2.5 hour wait! She informed me that she only dealt with Frequent Flyer issues and that I needed to speak to Reservations. She then told me she would put me through to Reservations. I waited over an hour on hold again and then gave up! I made another 2.5 hour attempt to speak to someone tonight, again with no joy! Qantas Customer Service is appalling and disgusting, and simply non-existent. They know nothing of the stress they are causing their Customers.

"""whole experience was awful""","The worst customer service I have ever received. I booked a one way flight with Qantas on the 22nd February over the phone using a voucher. Despite being told you can save time and book online, of course the website didn't allow it so I had to call. I waited hours on the phone when I initially booked. Skip forward a month I still hadn't received an email confirmation. This has happened every time I have booked with Qantas so I have wasted so many hours on hold to them just to get an itinerary sent through. After waiting several hours for a call back, an itinerary was sent by email. I noticed there was only 35 minutes between connecting flight so called back to confirm that the two flights would be the same plane. The customer service rep then told me no booking existed! After an hour on the phone there was no resolution, and I had to go into a meeting. She told me she would call back first thing in the morning to confirm it had been resolved. No surprises, she didn't call back. I called Qantas at 430PM, waited 5hrs on hold, then another 3hrs after getting through, mostly on hold, with no clue what was being done. At one stage I was placed back on hold for over an hour, with no one checking in. I spent a total of 8 hours on the phone, finishing the call at 1245AM!!!! The customer service rep and manager I spoke to were in no way apologetic and made no attempt to offer remuneration for a quite clear Qantas error. I ended up getting a flight but had to pay an additional $120, which they refused to waive! I had no choice with booking with them as there were no available flights with any other airline prior to Easter. To top it off when the eticket was emailed through, the customer service rep hung up without apologising or letting me remain on the line to provide feedback. The whole experience was awful. I won't ever be booking with them again. I'd love to say this experience is isolated to the customer service, however Qantas is by far the most expensive airline, yet most flights out of Alice Springs don't have WIFI and you don't get served meals.

So I ended up having to pay for a whole new booking from scratch. The service at the airport was also poor. No one in the check in area to help with check in kiosks or luggage check. The lounge experience sucked. My wife got turned away because she was wearing flip flops. Fair enough, there’s a dress code. Went in to get takeaway coffees at least, but they were no good.

"""lost all confidence in Qantas""","My partner bought a return trip from London to Perth last year (flying in June this year) and we thought all would be fine as long as the border opened in time. Over the past few months Qantas has been sending him emails with his flight times changing constantly, giving him long stopovers with nowhere to sleep in between and no option to change the flights to a more suitable one. There is no way to update your flights online and no way to 'accept' the changes. He thought he would call the customer service centre and ask them to change it but couldn't get through, even waiting over 2 hours on the call at one point before giving up. All the while being charged for the call. It was then that I discovered the hundreds of upset customers on various forums who were having the same issues and worse (such as flights being cancelled for no reason). We lost all confidence in Qantas at that point and he rebooked his flight on Qatar Airways. Unfortunately, it looks as though he might not see a refund from Qantas as there is no way to contact them and he has lost thousands because of it. Apparently they charge cancellation fees and give you a 'credit', which is fair enough when the cancellation is due to personal reasons, but not when it is because of airline incompetence.

My original flight was meant to be Cebu - Singapore - Perth. I was due to depart on March 27th. (Yes, I know that it's in the future). When I went for my pre-departure COVID-19 RT-PCR test, Scoot(no QF!) advised me that there was no code sharing in place with the two airlines, and that I would be unable to transit overnight in Singapore. I had already explained my situation to QF staff who had told me that everything would be fine. I filed a complaint online with QF about 2 weeks ago on their Facebook page. No reply. And there has been a major communications outage in Cebu after typhoon Odette passed through. A week or so ago, I looked at the QF webpage to see what I could do, and they give no refunds, only flight credits. Surely there must be some law against this? I will get the issuer of my credit card to look into this further. All I know is that I will never, ever use Qantas again, even for domestic flights within Australia. Even though Scoot is a budget airline, and despite my recent complaints about their cancellations on me, they at least managed to bring my flight forward and get me home, so kudos to them.

I booked flights to Europe a week ago, which took 2 hours over the phone as I was using a flight voucher - customer service rep didn't know how to apply a voucher.

Called again next day, 2 hour wait, 45 mins with another customer service rep who I told multiple times, to call me back if the phone dies, guess what - phone died and no call back. Called the next day, spoke with a lady who was based in South Africa - seemed like I was getting somewhere here - said she would follow up with Emirates who was the airline I was actually flying with, and then would call me back the following day. I asked her to promise me - she promised - she didn't. Today - called again and spoke with another non interested customer service rep - explained again for the forth/fifth time and asked to speak to her Team Leader - said she would pass on the message and her Team Leader would call me in 90 minutes - still no call 3 hours later. I still have no flights booked and cannot contact Qantas! This is absolutely not ok and unacceptable. As a Gold Status member - I will not be using Qantas again after this week.

"""never experienced such a bad customer service""","I booked a business class ticket to Adelaide from Brisbane 2 weeks before departure. After booking I've never received an e-ticket or confirmation per email. I was only able to see my booking online and on the Qantas app. I didn't change any of my existing details with Qantas and on the same email address I've received tickets and confirmations before. After that I've tried to request an invoice online multiple times which ended in receiving an error message. I also tried to call customer service, which I gave up after waiting 1 hour in the queue and the offered call back never came. Before the flight I checked in online which worked fine and received my confirmation of check-in and my boarding pass. Then, 2 hours before departure I received a call from Qantas and they told me the flight is oversold and I have to take the next one, which is 10 hours later or downgrade to economy class. Due to I had to be in Adelaide at a certain time I didn't have a choice and agreed to take the economy ticket, mostly I fly economy anyway. When I asked what the price and the refund is going to be it turned out Qantas charges me $800 for a eco-flex ticket which usually only cost $600, and I know because I have booked that ticket multiple times before and even my return flight is eco-flex for $600. The lady on the phone told me she can only give me the currently available price which of course is much higher 2 hours before departure. So, not only am I downgraded shortly before the flight, on top of that I am punished for Qantas mistake of overselling and have to overpay for a ticket just to get to my desired destination in time without being offered a better deal or any kind of compensation. It's really not nice to feel being taken advantage of because I have a schedule. Unfortunately Australia doesn't have many airlines to choose from and they get away with bad customer service. I guess they need more competition to be forced to improve their services. I never experienced such a bad customer service in over 10 years of frequent flying. 90% of my over 200 flights were done with Star Alliance and they offer great service.

"""I would have to pay a no-show fee""","On 4th January 2022, I showed up two hours prior to my flight from Nice, France to Sydney, Australia, willing to board my Qantas flight to Dubai (operated by Emirates). At the check-in counter, I was informed that I was not going to be able to board the flight because of issues with a layover in Brisbane. Despite showing them an Australian government website page that stated that layovers of less than 8 hours were accepted without quarantine, they did not want to know and said I was not able to board the flight and that I would have to rebook. When asking if I could rebook a flight with them, they said that I had to call their customer service line (with the unavoidable 2 hours wait as is ordinary for airlines). I did everything I could to get another ticket with the same departing flight from Nice, including asking some relatives to line up on the customer line for me. I finally got a ticket sold to me, knowing my current situation, only to being told that the check in was now closed (I bought the ticket on the phone in front of them at the desk). Following hours on the phone to begin the process of refund, I got told that they cancelled the Dubai-Brisbane flight that I was supposed to get. I also learned that I would have to pay a ""no-show"" fee if I were to ask for a refund, as the ticket was not cancelled at least 24 hours prior to departure. Emirates and Qantas say they cannot do anything.

I have waited months and months of back and forth to no avail, several weeks between each reply where they don't even read what I've written and just throw a copy and paste that is of zero help and doesn't resolve anything. Then another few weeks before they do the same to my reply. Told me to get advice from the bank, I got it, provided it to them, and they did the exact opposite of what the bank suggested - refunding to an old account, which is no longer retrievable - so they have literally lost me several hundred dollars because they didn't take the advice they asked for. Have made me waste hours on numerous in person visits and phone calls with my bank, hours of wasteful messages, and all the while have zero empathy and zero recognition of their own mistake - and a complete refusal to even read a word I say and acknowledge what has happened. Must not have a copy and paste for that. They can't even, after months of asking, simply call me to discuss. They refuse to escalate and refuse to call me. Waste of time, waste of money, disgusting service. Would literally pay 10x as much for a flight through someone else simply to avoid this company who talk in circles and ignore everything I say. Steer clear especially in times like these where you are likely to have to deal with customer service.

I get that everybody wants to secure their financial well-being, but it’s unacceptable to be penalized for canceling a flight early due to increasing numbers of infections and lockdowns. I canceled my flight when Queensland imposed a two week mandatory quarantine for any visitor. Months later when I’ve become unemployed, I reached out to Qantas for a refund only to be told that I had canceled too early and would be given a $500 cancellation fee. I tried reasoning but was only ignored. I was told that I could report a complaint on the company website. I did and a month later, I asked the representative from twitter when I was going to get a reply. I got one a day later, reiterating the same from the twitter rep. It was then that I noticed that the twitter rep and the person who responded to my email was the same person. I have spent more than a month being ignored, misdirected and delayed only to have the same person tell me the same thing through a different platform. I showed my Australian friend (who recommended Qantas) this and he couldn’t believe it. Qantas is held in high regard there but that doesn’t entitle a company to give someone the runaround when he’s trying to get a refund.

Below show the second part of my itinerary which should be departing from KUL to MEL via SIN. Timeline: Day 1 I postponed my flight on this day and it charged me AUD $243.30, which initially mentioned on the web page that postponing flight would cost me $0 but there is a hidden fee applied, which did not show nor mention before. Day 2 I received an email from the airline regarding changing of my flight. But it did not give me any option to choose from besides changing my itinerary on my behalf. Day 3 My flight was cancelled by the airline and was notified that my remaining flight would be transfer into a credit voucher with their company and I could making future flight booking with no additional charges, note that differences in fare would apply. And I would get a confirmation about details of my credit voucher via email within a week. It also mentioned in the same email that this conformation email would outline the option available for me. Day 4 Spoke to Qantas Airline on Facebook about the situation and was told that in my case, I was told that I am not allow for refund as it is a half flown booking, and because of this, I could not get my confirmation about my credit voucher on email. Besides that, I was told by customer service that I would be the one owe them money if they were to reassess the cost of this flight because cancellation fee would cost AUD $400.

February 22nd 2020, I, my wife and 3 years old baby were about to check in for our flight from Queenstown to Bali with connection in Sydney. I bought tickets on the official website of Qantas airlines. There was a connecting flight in Sydney: same airport, same terminal, same airlines and only 2h to next connecting flight to Bali. So in Queenstown Qantas staff didn't allow me to board as my Ukraine passport requires me to have a transit visa to Australia even I was not going to go out of the terminal. I supposed to go through transit (transfer) corridor. I have been travelling a lot and I have never experienced the situation when visa is required for transit in the airport same terminal. So of course I didn't know about it. But I accept that the governments of different countries sometimes might have strange rules. The problems were: Qantas did not even try or intend to inform me about my visa either during the booking or prior to flight. It's a special rare case, and I believe, I should have received a notification while booking or after via email. Please, improve your online booking system and add this feature. Its easy to do for your IT.  Moreover, in my ticket is stated ""A visa is permission for a non-citizen to travel to or transit through a particular country. To find out if you need a visa for travel to a particular country, visit the IATA Travel Centre"". So I visited IATA Travel Centre, input all my details and it did NOT say that I have to have transit visa to Australia. Please, check third party sources before you refer there. Even IATA can provide inaccurate information. During check-in in Queenstown, I was not raising my voice or so, but just said that its a fail of Qantas. A rude lady (employee of Qantas) wasn't happy about that. I asked her what is the solution and she said that I should buy new ticket from another airline or ""go back and stay in your country"". I find it discriminative instead of trying to help. Please, do better training for your team. 10-15 min after ""failed check-in"" I came back to the check-in desk (to another manager) to get some an insurance letter that I wasn't board.

One of the escape doors was inoperative so 100 odd seats were blocked out which meant the rest of the main deck was packed.

Qantas had no ground crew in Bali so everything was organise by the airport team. The Lounge they offer to their premium passengers was absolutely disgusting, everything about it was not great and I would never recommend it. The cabin crew were good at best, some were grumpy and others pleasant plus the customer service manager was definitely NOT a standout. Once airborne, I headed straight to sleep as the flight was about 5.5 hours and I was exhausted at that point due to the delay. Before landing I had a small breakfast of oats and coffee, the oats are one of my favourite things to eat so 1 point to Qantas.

But no matter what date I chose, they wouldn't let me fly the return leg home. They made me use a Jetstar flight to Cairns, check everything out (snow bag), and check back in to the Qantas link flight. You also couldn't amend anything for the Jetstar leg through Qantas. You had to do it through Jetstar. Then when I asked Jetstar they said I had to do it through Qantas, Qantas said the opposite. This was a never-ending occurrence, and a major pain. Also, you don't get free meal service and inflight entertainment with the Jetstar leg. Even though it's booked through Qantas. Rude if you ask me.

The food was not good at all : I mean, apart for the Kit Kat chocolate bar and for the glass of water, it was really bad. I was supposed to have rice with tuna curry and the rice was partly crunchy on the surface and mushy under the surface, the tuna was overcooked, the curry had a faint spicy flavour, so, I was really disappointed about it. I'm conscious that airplane food is not always exceptional or good but  I would be ashamed to serve food like that to people. The inflight entertainment is good as you have a screen on which you can watch movies, play games, listen to music, etc. I would say that it's the biggest positive thing about this flight.

How can a company try to justify that it’s ok to move customers off a flight they have purposefully booked and paid for months in advance? My new bumped onto flight was then so delayed instead of arriving at my destination at half nine a.m. it ended up being 2.40 pm.

I called again and received the same message but still no call back. I called the following day and waited 1hr 45min on the phone. I spoke to the customer service agent and she told me that I have to go through a resolution dispute system with Jetstar by filling in an online form. This form will then be assessed by a team who will decide whether i am entitled to a refund. Now I ask what intelligence is there in a system which is designed to waste people's time on the phone & online, waste administrative resources addressing the dispute and making people really angry at the end of it all when they could easily implement a policy that allows you to cancel your booking within 24hours of commitment. This is the system in the US. It works perfectly well there. There are no endless pages of terms and conditions you have to trawl through of legal jargon to understand. And everyone gets it without wasting people's time. Surely it would be cheaper to refund my $160 flight than the wages alone involved in 'resolving' this dispute. But I was told by the CS agent that this is not Australian Consumer Law so Qantas is within it's rights to waste everyone's time and achieve nothing but resentment and hostility.

Same here but Netflix, book and sleep sorted that out. London to Perth is usually around 16.30 hours but this time we did it in 16 hours.

Received an upgrade to Premium which was nice. The A380 cabin upstairs is compact and quiet. Aircraft was one of the ones that had not been refurbished, so older style of seating and IFE. Problem with upgrades is you cannot choose where you sit. It was at the bulkhead. Positive being that you have no one reclining into you. Negative. I am tall so not quite enough room to stretch out. Its a comfortable seat though and managed to get some decent sleep. Being a QFF, the cabin manager does come by for a personal thank you and greeting which is a nice touch. F & B up to usual standards. Normally the IFE selection is good but this time could not find anything that really appealed. Luckily had Netflix loaded up plus a book.

No emails from Qantas were received. A couple of days later I emailed them myself and got a reply back 2 weeks later, stating that I need to wait another 14 business days for a response. A month later I gave up on waiting, emailed them again, no response. I called them, queue was too long and they were meant to call me back in 2.5 hours. I waited 6.5 hours for a call back. Got through but guy from Qantas call centre couldn't help me and transfered to another department where I waited for an 1.5 with no response.

"""very disappointed with Premium Economy""","My wife and I are Lifetime Qantas Club members and are regular international travellers. We recently flew Qantas Premium Economy from Melbourne to Singapore and return and were very disappointed with Qantas Premium Economy on their A380-800. Both aircraft appeared a little tired and in need of updating. On the outbound flight QF35/03NOV MEL/SIN there was refuse from the previous traveller still in the seat pocket and under the seat in front. The ONLY benefit that we perceived over Economy was the extra legroom and the Upper Deck appears quieter than the lower deck. The Premium seat is marginally wider than in Economy and the legroom is definitely greater however that is where the comparison ends. After two hours the seat bottom was hard, the leg/foot rest is useless and must have been designed for 4ft leprechauns. We found it impossible to get sufficiently comfortable to sleep on the overnight flight. Meals on both flights were very ordinary with little difference to what we have previously experienced in QF Economy. On our return flight QF36/20Nov SIN/MEL the menu offered a Teriyaki Chicken Salad or Pesto Linguini or Black Bean Beef with rice. We chose the Teriyaki Chicken salad however they had run out of it. I then decided on the Pesto Linguini which had dry linguini and I left most of it on the plate. If the menus are an example of Rockpool Sydney then I pity them. The wine list states Premium Australian wines however the only wines on offer were a very insipid Pino Noir and a very ordinary Chardonnay. No spirits were offered. The cabin steward referred to my wife as 'Darling' even though he had never met her. Overall we do not feel that the substantial fare difference between Economy and Premium Economy was justified on this occasion. Having flown in all classes on many airlines over the years we can confidently say that the best Premium Economy we have is experienced is on Air New Zealand MEL/AKL/LAX and Business Class on Japan Airlines MEL/TYO/LON.",1,6,G meares,2019-11-22,yes,Premium Economy,Couple Leisure,Singapore to Melbourne,November 2019,3,3,4,3,3,Qantas Airways

Then after making 3 calls (each call being a minimum of 2 hours), I received my eticket only to realise nothing has been changed!

The cabin crew on this flight were a lot better than my departure out of Melbourne. As it was a 7 hour flight, I decided to opt in for a quick supper and head straight to bed. The crew understood that sleep and rest was precious on red eye flights that even during meal service they had dime the lights down enough to set the mood for sleep but can still serve food for other passengers. During the flight, the customer service manager greeted me and my partner with arrival cards and express cards for immigrations into Australia, a nice personal touch that I appreciate from any airline. The seat itself was comfortable enough and I did manage to get 3 hours of sleep but are definitely showing their age. IFE was really good but the older generation screen limits the options they can upload and the quality is not the best.

I checked onto the flight on line and dropped our baggage in at the Changi Airport and waited. At 12:30 pm I received a text stating the flight had been cancelled. There was no explanation or advise on what to do. Not even an apology! I tried calling Qantas but no one would answer. We tried to speak to someone from Qantas at the Airport but no one was available. When passengers arrived at 4:30pm to check in they couldn't and the Qantas staff who arrived at the same time had no idea the flight had been cancelled or what to do. They made calls and said they had no idea what was going on. After some time they told us the flight had been rescheduled for the following night. I had no baggage as I had checked it in.

Travelling in economy was a misery on both legs of this return ticket. The first leg I was at least pleased to receive good quality food and there was some attentiveness provided by the crew who walked around with jugs of water and offered refills sporadically during the flight. Maybe at 2hr intervals. On the return leg there was announcement at the start of the flight telling passengers that they must get up and refill the water bottle handed out at start of flight (we all know that water from plane tanks is risky, especially on a 25 year old 747). There was then no drinks service throughout the flight. After second meal service (7 hrs into flight) there was no service for the remaining 6.5 hours. The economy crew remained huddled in the curtained-off galley. I went down and politely asked for a coffee. The flight attendant was unpleasant, did not smile and made me feel like I was asking a favour. This crew was particularly rude, except for one nice attendant in the business cabin that said hi. I am so disappointed that this is the standard provided by our national carrier. Qantas you are letting your country down. I will get a Oneworld Emerald status match from another oneworld carrier and use Qantas for my lifetime gold when I have to fly for work. I've had good business class experiences on Qantas but if this is how you treat the majority of your customers they will definitely be one offs. I'd say you need to address your training and leadership standards. The maintenance of the aircraft is also an issue, my entertainment system was also faulty and seat uncomfortable and I am a normal size.

Good thing I notified them, because apparently I was just about to miss my flight, there is a hefty 500$ no show fee! Qantas should be aware that things do change for people. Bad weather happens, flights get delayed and rescheduled. I think it's absolutely ridiculous that they just want to get more money out of you instead of providing you with more suitable options.

"""the service was atrocious""","Tokyo to Brisbane. My husband and I purchased business class tickets so that we could have adequate legroom, be able to sleep, receive good service and have decent food. The customer service on the flight from Japan, however, was basically non-existent. After boarding we were essentially ignored and not offered the usual welcoming drink. Then, the first thing the crew did after take-off was to ask whether we wanted the bed made-up, this was before the food was served! The most insulting part was dinner. The salad put in-front of me was premixed with the dressing and too acidic for me to eat. Other airlines provide the dressing separately so that it can be added to taste. The bread offered was not warmed, as it is on many airlines, and we were not asked if we required any more. The main course of rice with a watery minced beef on top, but as it was delivered on a small plate the dish was a soggy mess. The food not only looked disgusting, but being soggy, was inedible. The crew, however, did not bother to ask why I did not eat the food, or offer an alternative, they simply eventually picked it up and said nothing. Although I was able to eat the dessert, it was not presented with any courtesy. Breakfast was also interesting, as I ordered cereal, yogurt, milk and a black tea. I was given a small bowl of cereal, but with the yogurt and milk mixed - not with the yogurt separate. Interestingly, when I requested milk for the tea, the crew member was surprised! I cannot understand why Qantas serves food to its customers in such a way, where all ingredients of the one dish are mixed on the same plate! Basically the crew could not be bothered and the service was atrocious. This is not the first time I have travelled business class with Qantas, but this flight was by far the worse in terms of both food and cabin service.

"""still awaiting for their respond""","We had our vacation in South America flew from East via Sydney with our first stop in Chile. Travelling time was much shorter compared flying via West. With airlines competitive promotional fares and the convenience of e-booking, we booked our flights with SQ and QF respectively. We know of the fact that we do not require entry visa to AUD meeting transiting requirements. SQ checked our baggage through to SCL on our outgoing flight. However, it was a nightmare on our return journey. We arrived at SCL airport 3 hours ahead prior to flight departure. It was a long queue when we arrived at about 10am. We were attended for check in about 45 minutes before departure. To our astonishment, QF refused to check us due to separate flight booking. Only then we learnt QF does not have baggage agreement with SQ hence they were incapable to check us. The solution was to have ETA to enter SYD, check out from the immigration and re-check in. As time was of the essence we requested the staff to apply ETA at a fee. However, the staff concerned deserted her counter and returned after about 15 minutes later. Worst of all the supervisor was all along sitting on the next counter knew of our predicament. The supervisor in question did not take her initiative to attend to us or exchange roles with her peer to resolve the situation. I felt that she knew time was running out, she tested our ignorance by telling us ETA will take 2 working days to process. Only on our insistence that it is 24/7 she processed upon our request. Nevertheless ETA received but QF flown without us. Neither did she render any assistance in getting us another flight home. We had to pay for any exorbitant fare on another routing home. We lodged our compliant to QF requesting for compensation and still awaiting for their respond. We queried SQ and they replied that our baggage were checked through to SCL based on their baggage policy for interline passengers.

Cabin crew were lazy. 1) Left side the plane got served food and the other half got served 30 minutes later. 2) Crew gave left side ice cream, other half waited 2 hours for theirs. We all had to reach over one another to put our rubbish in the bag that a steward opened and walked down the plane with, he would not pick rubbish off peoples tables (no service). 3) Three of the seats infront of me would not return to the uprite position. The head rests pushed tour neck forward causing upper back and trapeze pain (bad seat design). 4) Food served was 1 meal 2 hours into the flight. Boarded at 9 am, got in the air just after 11 am, food at 1.30pm. They seved a snack (tart dumpling 1.5 hours before we landed in Bangkok (9 hour flight). Usually that flight consists of 2 solid meals. I am a frequent flyer and I will never fly Qantas again. Garuda in the 1980's is better than Qantas in 2019.

Qantas Airways customer review,"Melbourne to Cairns. We booked our return flights thru Qantas but the first flight was designated to fly with Jetstar. We knew we had to buy food on board the flight so brought our own but were shocked to discover we did not get any water or a cup of tea without having to pay. There was no inflight entertainment either. Considering our return flight home was with Qantas and included lunch, water, a cuppa and inflight entertainment we are annoyed that we paid the exact same price each way. Also, staff were somewhat brusque on Jetstar compared to Qantas.",0,4,S Greenaway,2019-06-15,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,Melbourne to Cairns,June 2019,2,N/A,2,2,3,Qantas Airways

"""the service is extremely poor""",My wife and sister flew Qantas from Sydney to Vancouver via San Francisco on 4th June. Unfortunately after collecting their bags at San Francisco and having them forwarded to Vancouver they were never to be seen again. They boarded a cruise ship on 6th June with bags and with no real plan by Qantas (Westjet) on how they might receive them. Losing your bags may be a hazard of flying but lack of service when customers are seeking help should not be. Qantas say it is not their problem and you cant contact their carrier from Australia - the phones repeatedly ring out unanswered. Joining a cruise without bags and with no assurance that you will see your bags again for the next 14 days ruins expensive holidays. Qantas may be a good airline but the service is extremely poor.,0,4,Michael Wallace,2019-06-06,no,Business Class,Couple Leisure,Sydney to Vancouver via San Francisco,June 2019,4,4,1,5,1,Qantas Airways
"""experience was worse than expected""","Qantas is a legacy career and known for good service and great catering. My business class experience on an evening flight was worse than expected. - Flight attendants in business looked rather uninterested and definitely lacked some sparkle or a desire - No proper headphones- just standard from Economy which is weird for a legacy career - No menus distributed - Warm and cheap sparkling wine which is called as champagne, very bad choice of red wines, no spirits offered, no pillow or blankets are distributed (only by a request) - A choice of meals is strange and not coupled with an entre or a desert: cheese plate is an option #1, the portion is not big, only cheese, nothing else is included; tomato soup is an option number 2 - a soup alone, nothing else; option number 3 is a chicken with rice, looks like a good portion but again - no entre or a dessert. When I asked for any desert going with a tea - a tiny cookie was offered - No table cloth - Seats are large and offer a bit of recline and leg stand. - I was flying with a 2-month-old child and my first request for some water was ignored as staff were busy chatting with a flight attendant from Economy class A day before I was flying Qantas in Economy and experience was much better - very motivated crew passionately servicing passengers, extremely tasty warm egg and ham sandwiches, very prompt service. I compare Qantas short domestic flight with the same 1 hour and 15 minutes Aeroflot flight on a Moscow-Saint Peterburg flight - Aeroflot business class is outclassing Qantas on everything - French premium champagne, a wide range of spirits and fine wines, noise-canceling headsets, proper beautifully decorated table service, extensive menus, each meal contains a salad or entre, a proper dessert. I am disappointed with Qantas and very surprised by a fact some Russian and Europeans airlines (not even mentioning WEmirates or Qatar service on 1-hour flights) are completely outclassing Qantas.

On arrival into Sydney I had 10 minutes to run from the domestic terminal to the international terminal, go through passport control and then go through security screening for a second time - why?! I literally made the Queenstown flight by the skin of my teeth but unfortunately my bag did not. On arrival into Queenstown it became apparent that’s my suitcase had been left in Sydney. This seems to have been the case with a number of other passengers on the SYD to ZQN flight! The sheer number of passengers who’s bags didn’t arrive is just sheer negligence in my view. When trying to get help in getting my bags returned, all I was told was “give us an address and your bag may turn up tomorrow” - definitely not very reassuring. And no specific time was given either - will my bag arrive in the morning? In the afternoon? In the evening? Who knows?! Props to Qantas for giving me $60NZD in compensation and a set of pyjamas and some toiletries - but it’s just not good enough.

Yes there are some circumstances that they cannot control but there is a point where it is no longer coincidence. Qantas international is great for me but Sydney to Melbourne and Melbourne to Sydney flights are some of the most frustrating experiences I have ever had. No matter if I book an early or late flight the result is the same. I guess I should consider myself lucky that my flights aren't being cancelled?

Unbelievable. I really feel for the pilots and flight crew if they have to work in these ridiculous conditions constantly.

"""Qantas was quite variable""","Melbourne to Los Angeles via San Francisco. My recent trip to Canada via the United States with Qantas was quite variable in the quality of experience between two of their premium products. We flew Premium Economy on the A380 from Melbourne to Los Angeles and then were happily upgraded from premium to business on the new 787 from San Francisco to Melbourne on our return. The service in Premium was exceptional - the best I have experienced. The food was delicious - for me a stylish and well presented lamb shank and my wife a terrific fish dish. And the service was cheerful and frequent - including regular water service and snacks. Breakfast was similarly good. Top marks all round. The business leg that we were so anticipating on the return was a little disappointing. The food prepared by the caterers in the states was surprisingly tasteless, overcooked in every case and disappointing - both meal services. The salad with supper was simply indescribable. The crew were much less conspicuous on this flight (of course the idea is to not be too conspicuous) but you didn't feel encouraged to ask for anything. No water runs and little sight of the crew. And they were very short of PJs in business and were all one size. This time around the choice of movies was surprisingly thin.

The provision of only one toilet for 28 premium passengers on an overnight international flight is unacceptable for an airline that claims to be a premier, full service airline. Whoever made this decision needs to be given a reality check about the expectations of premium paying passengers. Finally, the egg and bacon roll presented at breakfast looked like a lacquered show-case you see in Asian restaurant windows. The egg was dry and tasteless.

"""worst flights I've taken""","Los Angeles to Brisbane. I took two Qantas flights recently to visit Australia. The first from Los Angeles to Brisbane, and the second was the return portion from Sydney to Vancouver, Canada. They were the two single worst flights I've taken in 20 years of flying. On both flights my gluten free meal didn't make it. 28 hours flying time without food. Even though I ordered it 4 weeks before departure, I was told they didn't receive it in time (?!). A few minutes later, the same cabin attendant then gave me a bread roll and a regular meal as if we hadn't just has a conversation about gluten allergies. After picking at something I thought I might be able to eat I became painfully ill. A pain that lasted 3 days after the flight. As I was getting off the flight, a cabin crew member told me it was my own fault for eating their food. Nice touch Qantas. The return flight was worse. It was delayed by 25 hours due to an engineering issue. This resulted in a missed connection which gate staff assured me would be reimbursed so long as rebooking occurred through the One World network. After paying significantly more money to stay within the network, and presenting the receipts as instructed, Qantas customer service told me they wouldn't be reimbursing the cost. Furthermore, they lied about providing passengers with a letter at the gate explaining this. No such letter was ever given to passengers. So I arrived 25 hours late, +$500 out of pocket, and most gallingly, after following every instruction given to me by Qantas staff, being told by customer service that it was my own fault. How does this airline even exist in 2019? From gate staff, to cabin crew to customer service, every single person was rude, condescending and confrontational, not a single one of whom accepted responsibility for anything. Every single inconvenience, delay and cost, no matter how small, was my problem, my fault and my cost to bear. Never, and I can't stress this enough, never fly with Qantas.

"""no more than a low-budget airline""","Hong Kong to Brisbane. This is my third flight with Qantas in the past 12 months and each departure has been delayed: the first time for 5½ hours departing Brisbane, second time for 1 hour departing Los Angeles and now this current flight Hong Kong to Brisbane delayed for 55 mins. Qantas is no longer the ‘pride of Australia’. It is now Jetstar with the flying kangaroo on its tail. Over the past few years, Qantas has become a very poor relative to this once great airline. It is now no more than a low-budget airline that charges full-service fares. What a joke!!! I know Alan Joyce has brought the airline from the brink of bankruptcy to being ‘in the black’ financially but at what cost to passenger loyalty? In fact, after this flight, I will never ever fly Qantas again. There are far, far better quality international airlines than Qantas to choose from that take pride in providing service excellence to their passengers. As for meals and amenities! It was about 9.30pm (approx 1½hrs after take-off) before the meals and drinks cart came around. Why do passengers now have to wait until meal time before the drinks trolley comes around? I’m not a big drinker but a nice refreshment once up in the air would have been very welcome. The menu had a choice of 3 main meals, a vegetable with rice, a chicken casserole with mashed potato, beans and carrot (my choice) and a fish with rice. My meal was tasty but very, very small. This came with a small mousse as dessert, a small bread roll and a choice of an alcoholic beverage. No further alcohol was served. Gone are the days where a good sized food tray came with entrée, main, dessert, fruit and cheese and biscuits. No snacks, not even a small bag of nuts, were served at all during the flight though the menu did state that fruit would be served mid-flight; I saw no evidence of that. We were woken for breakfast approx. 3am Hong Kong time (5am Brisbane time). Breakfast consisted of a small tray of fruit: 2 triangles of watermelon, 2 small wedges of apple, a round of dragon fruit, and a piece of pineapple; a small sweet muffin, accompanied by tea, coffee or fruit juice. That was it!! The amount of food & beverages provided over the almost 10 hours we were aboard this flight was very inadequate and would not have satisfied my 4 year old grandson. I’m a small person (female) weighing 57 kilos so I am not a big eater, I was starving by the time I arrived in Brisbane. Amenity packs are no longer so I walked to the back of the plane and asked a flight attendant if he could provide me with ear plugs. Reluctantly he found a pack. I asked if he had an eye- mask and he said ‘No’. He must have had a pang of conscience as he then looked in another drawer and found more earplugs and a mask. I was very thankful as like most passengers in economy, I don’t sleep well on a flight and earplugs and eye-mask certainly help. As for in-flight service, there isn’t any. From this final experience of flying Qantas, I get the impression that the service and cut-backs in food and amenities is all about cost-cutting ie: keeping costs down and the shareholders happy. There is no consideration for economy passengers in fact, I have the impression that Qantas finds economy passengers an inconvenience and thus are treated as not worth looking after. It is a very sad outcome for all – Qantas as a brand has gone the way of the dodo.

I called Qantas again and after being on hold for 2 hours they tried to pretend as if they were calling Jet Airways to help and cut the call. It was the worst customer service experience ever. Nether Jet nor Qantas took the responsibility.

"""the worst customer service""","Auckland to San Francisco via Sydney. I would not recommend anyone to fly with Qantas and I will never be flying with them again. My sister and I flew from Toronto to Auckland via Dallas and was supposed to be Sydney but ended up being Brisbane and then finally to Auckland. The return trip was Auckland to Sydney to San Francisco to Toronto. Not one leg of the trip left on time and when we left Dallas to supposedly fly to Sydney we were informed almost immediately after takeoff that we would likely have to stop in Brisbane to refuel as there were strong headwinds over Australia at this time of year and we would likely not make it to Sydney. This extra stop was going to take an extra 2-2.5 hours which meant that we would not make our connection to Auckland. Finally we were told that we were going to Brisbane and that everyone on the plane would have to get off and take a different flight the rest of the way. In what seemed like the most disorganized way possible we were finally put on a flight to Auckland but in the process they misplaced our luggage and when we got to Auckland our luggage was not there and that ended up taking until after noon the next day before they finally cleared it and brought it to us. Then on the way back we got to Sydney ok, but once there the flight we were taking to San Francisco had a technical issue and boarded about 2 hours late. Then we were told when we got on the plane that this was a really old plane and this was its last flight ever! After we got to San Francisco it was going to be taken to the desert and retired; isn't that comforting to hear when you're late getting on a plane because of a technical issue! This plane was so old that the screens didn't even have a flight path so that we could see what time we were due to arrive in San Francisco and because of the different time zones we were going through we had no way to know if we were actually going to make our next flight. The staff at one point came around and told certain people that they were not going to make their connecting flight and they had been booked on a different flight but they didn't have anything for us; they said if they didn't have any information for us that meant that we should be able to make our connection. So then we finally get to San Francisco only to find out that unlike what we were told in Auckland we now had to completely go through security again and re-check our bags which took forever and when we finally got through the customs line and got to our gate we had missed our flight and there was not another flight to Toronto for 7 hours! So we sat and waited for 7 hours and then finally got to go to Toronto, where we had missed the hotel room we had booked because we didn't get there until morning. The manager at the Qantas boarding gate told us that we could put in a claim for this lost hotel booking, but when we did so we were informed that Qantas would not pay for this because they claimed that the technical issue on the plane was not their responsibility. Whose responsibility is it then, is what I'd like to know?!? Also, they ruined one of our checked bags, one corner ripped right open, and this happened on the way there but when we tried to get them to take responsibility for this they said this is also not their responsibility.

"""still room for improvement""","I have three issues with the Airbus 330-200 business class fight of Qantas from Singapore to Sydney. Seat - the new business class seat is very narrow and small, especially the footrest area after the bed has been extended to lay flat mode. I was not able to sleep on my side because my feet were not able to fit the footrest area. All the panels in the new seat are supposed to provide privacy for the passenger but they do also have the unintended effect of making the seats feel much smaller. Lack of toilet - There is only one toilet for the whole business class. There are 28 seats in business class and the business class passengers to toilet ratio must be the worst among all the premier full-service airlines. In the morning after breakfast was served and before the touch down at Sydney, the queue for the toilet was so bad that I did not even get a chance to go before we arrived in Sydney. Those 330-200 with the older version of business class seats have 2 toilets in Business class. I am wondering if Qantas chose to reduce the toilet number in order to fit in more seats. Coffee - The coffee that Qantas serves for breakfast is the worst that I have tasted for a long time. It was too diluted. After milk was added, the colour of the coffee was whitish brown. The coffee was definitely instant coffee. Qantas should invest in a better-brewed coffee machine for business class passengers. Hope that Qantas can look into the above three issues.

"""disgusting response""","Brisbane to Tokyo via Sydney. Here is an outline of events. Our flight from Brisbane on the 20th of December 2019 was delayed due to bad weather in Sydney. We were then kept in a holding pattern above Sydney for an hour or so, only to arrive in Sydney with a short time to get to our connecting gate. We were madly rushing to get to the new gate, only to find out that the gate had changed (which we weren’t notified of) and had also been delayed while they waiting for passengers being diverted from another flight. Now waiting for another couple of hours in the Sydney airport, we are finally told that the plane has engineering problems. After another half an hour of waiting we are told that the flight is cancelled because either the problem was not fixed or they couldn’t take off, as it was too late. My family and I then waited to find out what was happening next. After they had seen to all the local Sydney residents, we were next told that we were being put up in a hotel. When we arrived at the apartment, we were told that they couldn’t check us in because the Qantas credit card had been declined. At this time it was after 1am in the morning and we had been travelling for 8-9 hours. As a 6 person family, I was surprised they put us in an apartment that slept 4 people. Two of my children had to sleep on the floor. The hotel was not able to supply any roll out beds. We were also told that we had a $50 to spend per person, however when we arrived at the unit, there was clearly no where to get any food. So I had to go for a walk to find a Nightowl convenience store to find some food for the children. Likewise in the morning there was nowhere to find breakfast so I had to go out and find somewhere, being unable to use the credit vouchers I was told we had. During this time we had received no communication updates from Qantas with regards to our flight that had been rescheduled. When we arrived at the airport, I approached a Qantas person to check in our luggage. They directed me to another location, which we all followed. Upon arriving there, (I believe it was the standby counter) we were told that this was not the place and directed to another place. When we arrived there, we got in a queue to check in our luggage. About 15 min into the queue, a Qantas supervisor started coming over to us, yelling and shouting at us in an extremely unprofessional and disgusting way, telling us we were in the wrong place and that this counter was shutting. To which we informed her, that we had been directed by another Qantas staff member to come here. Eventually she allowed us to stay. However 10 min later, another family was coming over, which infuriated the Qantas supervisor even more, and again another shouting session occurred. She continued to complain loudly enough for everyone to hear, how bad it was that people were coming over. The other group was actually being accompanied by another Qantas staff member. So vicious was the shouting and exchange it brought the other Qantas staff member to tears, which made all of us and our family extremely uncomfortable. After a good deal more waiting we finally were at the stage of checking in our luggage. Only to be informed that they could check us in, but we needed to take our luggage somewhere else – to the oversized baggage section as the conveyor belt operators had left and it was no longer being used.

After several days of to and fro messages with the Qantas Bot asking for a refund for my missed flight (to cover the cost of eventually taking another flight home to Melbourne), I am horrified to be told that I am not eligible for a refund as I was a No Show. Qantas was advised well before the departure time that I had had an accident and was in hospital. The irony is that had I attempted to take the flight Qantas would not have allowed me on the flight in the condition I was in. I’ve always respected Qantas as a reputable Australian airline with the good old Aussie Spirit of caring for its customers. No more!

The lounge has gone from good to awful. Cost cuts have reduced ‘meals’ to racks of stale bread and tubs of kraft singles, ‘sandwich meat’ and tinned tuna with a do it yourself sandwich toaster.

"""meals were so disgusting""","I had the opportunity to travel with Quantas for the first time on my journey from London to Singapore (roundtrip) and I will never travel with this airline again. The staff was nice, seats average, where they lost the most amount of points for me was in relation to food and inflight entertainment. Usually on all of the long hall flights I travel on they offer such a range of amazing movies in different languages and varieties, but on Qantas they merely offered a few movies and out dated 'horror ones' there were no tv shows nor any documentaries it was all very lackluster. My biggest area of disappointment regards food, especially since I had requested a vegetarian meal. Now I am not a picky eater, but the meals offered were so disgusting that I was only able to take a few bites. When the meal arrives it is the main dish only on a trey with a piece of bread and desert in the bag thus taking away from the whole cute inflight meal aesthetic. It was very difficult for me to figure out what it was that I was going to eat as the food items did not look anything like food, I had to read the label in order to understand what is being offered. I did try the meals and could only stomach 2 bites each. I really wonder if the chef had tried what he had made, because it is a great disservice to the customer. This chef either needs to be retrained or fired, if he/she will go into retraining they should collaborate with those from Emirates, Korean, etc. Furthermore, the vegetables were so over cooked that any nutrients that should have been available ceased to exist.",1,2,B Vassani,2019-02-25,no,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,London to Singapore,February 2019,2,1,1,5,2,Qantas Airways

Was looking forward to trying out Qantas International again after 15+ years of choosing other airlines due to poor quality and service on my last flight. This time it was a mixed experience. The A380 is a fantastic aircraft  and I've been on the Singapore Airlines, Qatar, Malaysian and Emirates versions previously. Unfortunately the Qantas version had seen better times. This plane was old and although the seating was new, you could tell the rest of it had taken a beating including the carpets, toilets and galley. The flight attendants on this plane (although very polite) verged on the wrong side of professional vs casual friendliness and as we were seated next to the galley, we overheard way too much much casual gossip and cattyness which I felt was not doing the airline reputation much good. Our attendant even commented that he was 'exhausted' before the flight even took off. What was good : the food was pretty decent for economy, as were the free flowing tim-tams and bundaberg ginger beer available from the fridges at the back of the plane - well done, a nice touch and keep it up. Would I choose Qantas again? Probably not. The competition (particularly Singapore Airlines) has a better, more professional product. More needs to be done to bring Qantas up to this level.

This was not true as the man serving me was one of the rudest Australians I have come across. He had no manners and absolutely no courtesy. He also didn't know his job. I was more of a burden for him and he had no intentions of helping me out and didn't know what I would have to pay extra. After 15 mintues of me trying to explain my situation to him and it falling on deaf and dumb ears I had no option but to reduce my baggage.

Having just flown with Cathay, Finnair and Qatar business class all previously in the past 3 weeks it was an excellent opportunity to compare Qantas and where it sits as a quality air service provider. Sadly it rated a long distant last. It started with the Brisbane Business lounge at the international terminal where the food was scant and not worth eating. The staff were pleasant but the best bubbles they could serve was about a $12 Australian sparkling wine that really very ordinary. Every other carrier offered French champagne in their service offering - but not Qantas. Boarding the plane in Bangkok, the crew looked confused and tired and overall the service was minimal on-route to Sydney. The champagne served onboard was one of the cheapest available and the food was very ordinary. I had the salad as a starter and then the green curry vegetables and noodles. The green curry sauce has split and curdled and was very ordinary. The fresh fruit was nice. Breakfast was a bacon and egg ciabatta sandwich - they don’t serve hot breakfasts any more on Qantas flights! The entertainment was good, although the headphones are the poorest quality out of all the flights and my first set were faulty. The toilets were the same size as economy - small! Whereas the other airlines had much roomier bathrooms. The bathroom had paper towels whereas the others had cloth. There were no creams or amenities in the bathroom whilst the others all did. The plane was looking tired. The travel pj’s were a nice touch and comfortable. Overall Qantas is not rewarding its business class travellers with service and product offerings for which they are charging a premium price. It’s simply not worth the money. They appear to have cut too many corners to squeeze every cent of savings from the budget, but they forget the client is paying substantial money for the privilege of flying with them and it’s simply not worth it.

Completely disorganised, no process, no space, for queuing processes, pax getting angry with one another as they tried to access the designated queuing location ie Priority, 30-50, 50-75 etc....

The seat was terrible and does not compare the the newer aircraft ie LATAMs 787. The kind pax in front reclined for most of the trip, which gave me 20cm between the seat and my face. The cabin crew were the usual older Qantas cabin crew, who were efficient and as pleasant as they needed to be only. Being at the back, food options were significantly limited. They rearranged the menu and brought forward dinner instead of the mid-flight snack. Most annoying but i believe it worked for the crew. The crew did walk the aisles with water which was more than LATAM crew did. My seat, 71A was a two seat row and felt i had some extra leg room on the side which made the experience slight more bearable. As beautiful and as majestic as the 747-400 is she is an old bird and as such makes these long flights very uncomfortable and would see this flight much more improved if and when they switch the aircraft to a 787.

"""A huge improvement""","For the first time flew London to Brisbane via Perth on Qantas' 787 and experienced the new business class. A huge improvement for Qantas having aisle access for all seats. The individual seat amenity such as personal space, storage space and the seat itself is great. The London to Perth leg was 15 hours and 32 minutes which is not bad for such a long flight. The 787 cabin ambience is an improvement over the 747 and the A380. The food offerings were plentiful as were drinks. Cabin service was friendly. Between meal times, requests for hot chocolate and other items were quickly actioned. The entertainment options were vast and the screen was very responsive to touch. Toilet access throughout the flight was not an issue. Between meal times, there was a good variety of snacks to choose from. Arriving in Perth, very quick immigration clearance and a five minute walk to Qantas domestic to put the bags on the belt for Brisbane. The flight from Perth to Brisbane was on a 737. Again, the service was excellent. For this 4 hour flight, water runs were made. Both flights departed and arrived on time. This was the first time flying from London to Brisbane via Perth. Would I do this run again, probably not only for the reason that if I fly over Singapore, I can land directly in Brisbane and get a stop and a leg stretch. If I lived in Perth or Adelaide, i'd always be flying London - Perth.

Had I flown with Emirates it would not only have cost me less but would have also been a shorter flight. Sydney to Cape Town with Qantas took almost 30 hours to get there. They also then seated us separately even after having checked in initially with two seats together, they messed that up. Waited at the airport Qantas desk at check in for almost two hours trying to check in and sort that out as it was total chaos at the airport Qantas lines. The stewards and hostesses on the plane in general are unhelpful, giving you a distinct impression that everything and anything is too much trouble for them, I have flown Emirates, Air France, British Airways, Turkish Airlines internationally and never seen such chaos and had such a disappointing flight for years.

"""they never reply""","Kuching to Brisbane via Singapore. I am writing this review regarding the Qantas customer care service. Together with my spouse and daughter, we purchased our travel tickets via Qantas Airways website under two separate bookings. These are multi cities travel and we have made separate bookings because my daughter traveled earlier but her return tickets were the same time and dates with us. The problem arouse during our returns from Melbourne, Australia. On 29 Nov 18, when we checked in at Melbourne Airport, we requested for our bagages to be checked all the way to Kuching but the staff told us she cannot do that and she advised us to pick up our baggage at Kuala Lumpur. She also reminded us to pick up our boarding passes for Singapore/Kuala Lumpur at Changi Airport; then upon arriving at KL,pick up our luggage at Kuala Lumpur and check in at KLIA for the KL/Kuching flight. All our flights were on 29 Nov 2018. Because of time constraint, we missed our flight for Kuala Lumpur/Kuching. On the night of 29 Nov 2018, when we checked with MAS regarding the re-arrangement of our connecting flight from KL to Kuching, the staff told us to refer to Qantas since we have purchased our tickets via Qantas Airways website. Qantas does not open any counter or office at KLIA so I have to call their office at Kuala Lumpur. The telephone always got disconnected in the midst of conversation. Finally I managed to talk to one staff but he was not helpful. Because we have missed our flights so our appointments in Kuching for the following days have to be rescheduled. We have to purchase new tickets in order to travel from Kuala Lumpur to Kuching on 30 Nov 2018. When I wrote to Qantas customer care for them to give us letters to show proof of no boarding or no show, they replied and asked me to write to MAS. When I told them it should be their responsibility to give us the letter, and until today three weeks already passed they never reply. We feel that Qantas should be responsible to advise us when we make travel arrangement and bookings, especially under multi cities travel;  to compensate and help us in re-arranging our travel for the flights that we have missed; and to give us the assistance that we need and not just ignore and keeping quiet.",1,1,Yat Kiong Jong,2018-12-24,no,Economy Class,Family Leisure,Kuching to Brisbane via Singapore,November 2018,2,3,2,3,2,Qantas Airways

To add drama to this there is a delay to my flight and I have no idea when we are leaving as Qantas did not send me any details of this delay.

The first part of the flight from Newark to San Francisco was scheduled for 3pm however due to engine issues, we were advised every 20 minutes there would be further delays until we boarded at finally at 6pm. Once we boarded, the power shut down and we were delayed an additional hour and a half on the plane. For those of you with young kids you can imagine how hard it's starting to get traveling alone with a toddler. The flight landed around 10.30pm and as a result we had missed our connecting flight to Australia. I was advised by the airline crew on board that there was an 11.15pm flight to Sydney that we should take instead as the airlines are partners. When I disembarked from the plane with my two year old, whom was screaming and crying for hours due to the unsettlement of the delays, I noted my stroller was broken during the flight. So I had to carry my son, carry-on a broken stroller to the entire other side of the airport to try and board this flight. We get there and they advise us that the flight is full. It's now midnight. I ask when they will be re-booking us on the soonest flight out and they tell me all the Qantas agents have left and I will need to call online to rebook my son and I on a flight out and should go collect our luggage. I go with my son to collect our bags. I wait an hour and a half, our bag doesn't come off, at the same time, I've been on hold with Qantas customer service now for an hour and half and no one has answered... its now almost 2am in San Francisco airport on my own with my two year old.

We go to one hotel nearby... sold out... we call another car to find another hotel nearby, it's now 3.30am, we finally get a room and check in. Due to the late time and last minute, they did not have a crib for my son so he needed to sleep in a bed, I armed it best i could with pillows of course, but at 4.30am i hear a huge bang and outcry, my son had rolled off the bed and smashed his face in the corner of a nightstand, blood everywhere.

She argues with me and says to go ahead and book it if it’s ‘true’ (because I have nothing better to do at 5am with a baby... ) and that the check in agent will move the flight over when I express any charge concerns, you can imagine my level of fed up at this point.

There was a slight delay at the departure from Melbourne and when we got into the aircraft we were quite surprised to see the poor state of the cabin. The chairs still had food particles left from the previous flight and the tray tables were not wiped. Both our chairs had faulty reclining options. (52D/E) Since we were going on a holiday our spirits were very high positive so we ignored the poor cabin condition and sat on our seats. Then came the cabin crew with the meal service and they were an absolute match to the state of the cabin. Rude, totally unwelcoming and they were under the impression that they are doing us a favor. I got the feeling like we are travelling as a bunch of prisoners being transported from one country to another. No customer service at all. Also during the service my wife asked for a certain cocktail and the stewardess looked at her very sarcastically then laughed and offered a different one. They were also skipping passengers during the tea/Coffee service and rushed through that service. We finally arrived in Singapore and I was much relieved to leave that hostile environment. Approximately 2 weeks later we had to fly back home from Singapore on the 4th December. Singapore to Melbourne on QF 38. I must admit the consistency Qantas proved with poor cabin status and crew behavior was astounding. SIN/MEL sector my tray table was not cleaned and had some visible oily residue on it which I had to clean. The cabin crew that served in my area were unsmiling, arrogant and gave the impression that they are not happy to do their job and we the passengers are a nuisance. I felt very uncomfortable to just ask for a glass of water because most of the crew that worked in my area looked so grumpy. I must admit there was one stewardess that came for a short while maybe from business class to help and she was very pleasant. The meals that they serve for 7+ hour flight was a joke. There’s a hot snack they serve after takeoff and 2 hrs before landing to Melbourne the choice of food was an over cooked omelette or a plain fruit bowl. Come on people the hot omelette just comes by itself and no yogurt or fruit to accompany it. I have flown with Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Sri Lankan airlines in the same MEL/SIN/MEL sector and the customer service and the choice of meals serve these other airlines provide are far superior to Qantas.

I don't expect much even though I have a Platinum tier with Qantas, but I do expect the standard service and anything above that, is much appreciated. One thing that is obvious with the cabin crew is their inconsistency in regards to addressing customers, the customer service manager called me 'sir' rather than my name and addressed another passenger by name. I know it's a small issue (and some people could careless) but it says a lot about the training or lack of. Moving on, the hard products was amazing as the Suites were very comfortable.

The service provided takes no account of the time of day, serving the standard small meal and drinks when you just wanted some shut-eye.

We paid $30 per seat so that we could sit together and watch out for each other because some of the grandparents are in their 80's and do not speak English. However, when we checked in, we found out all our seats were re-arranged and in the worst possible way! Our 4 year old child was assigned in middle seat no where near his parents. In addition, the family was divided in half, separated by the service station.

We spoke to the woman who was the head of the stewardess about the problem upon boarding, she said she would try to see what she could do, but she never got back to us at all. The seats were horrible seats for a few reason. First, our family of 7 were completely separated and my wife and I could not take care of the old and the young easily. Second, there were a lot of traffic and noise from crew and other passengers because they were next to the Service station.Third, we were always the last one to receive food service because of the location. This is a problem when we have 4 year old and 80 years old who were diabetics. In addition, the person in front of us had her seat reclined so far back, it was hard to get in and out of our seats to go to the bathroom. We as a family travel internationally twice a year for the last 10 years. This flight is probably the worst one we had ever been in.",1,2,Megan Leung,2018-09-21,no,Economy Class,Family Leisure,Sydney to San Francisco,August 2018,1,1,2,3,1,Qantas Airways
"""an absolute nightmare""","Honolulu to Melbourne via Sydney. My recent trip back from Honolulu was and still is an absolute nightmare. Coming from someone who's travelled some of the lowest rated airlines in the world whilst backpacking around Asia my expectation of customer service is very low and I guess I had an expectation that if anything was to go wrong with Qantas we would be looked after, how was I wrong. We were notified that one of our bags was held up (despite providing both bags to Qantas at the same time at the domestic transfer lounge) and that the second bag would be delivered to us the following day and we would receive a phone call advising a 3 hour window our bag would be delivered. Not ideal as we had been away for a while but we sucked it up and figured it could be worse. The following day we received a call saying our bag had arrived and we would receive it between 3 and 6 pm. At 8pm we had not heard anything further and our bag still had not arrived, after calling Qantas baggage services and being on hold for 45 minutes (something that we are quite used to now) we were told the courier had arrived at 1pm but couldn't find our bag and they had no idea where it was. They suspected the wrong courier may have taken our bag and it would come back eventually and they would call us the following day. After not receiving a call the next day we called back and nothing had been received. The 3 staff were laughing at how ridiculous the situation was, something we took great offence to. 3 days later we called back for an update and asked kindly for some form of allowance for everyday items and advice around whether we could start replacing a few items. A member of staff thought this was quite reasonable and couldn't believe we weren't offered anything prior but after speaking to her manager she offered 2 x lounge passes. Absolutely useless, we have no plans to fly Qantas and there's no way they will help us in this situation. We of course declined this offer. Forward 21 days until our baggage would be considered lost we submitted a lost baggage claim for $3.9k - We were offered $2k as a final claim and asked to sign a confidentiality agreement and a form which relieves Qantas of any responsibility. I've been asked to do this despite 2 members of staff admitting it was 100% Qantas' fault. They couldn't believe couriers could just take whatever bags they wished and there was no need to sign in or out bags. We are told we are free to claim the additional through travel insurance something we have no intention to do. Qantas need to take responsibility for what they've done and simply reimburse the full replacement cost of our items.",1,1,P Hallem,2018-09-17,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,Honolulu to Melbourne via Sydney,August 2018,2,2,1,1,1,Qantas Airways

"""let down by operations""","We experienced 2-hour delays on QF23 Sydney to Bangkok and on the return sector QF38 Singapore to Melbourne. Flight tracking shows this is quite normal especially on the SYD-BKK sector. We arrived at BKK with 30 minutes to get through immigration and re-screening for connecting flight to Phuket. Incorrect information given to our travelling companion by Qantas check-in staff regarding uplifting of luggage in BKK and rechecking in for Phuket saw items purchased in SYD confiscated at re-screening. The checked-in luggage was in fact checked through to Phuket. On arrival to Phuket I found my luggage did not make it. On departure day, we received notification that QF38 was going to be delayed leaving SIN which meant missing our onward connection to NZ. As I was in Business Class, I was rescheduled with additional flight from MLB to SYD and then to NZ. My travelling companions fared worse. They were rescheduled to fly on a different airline the following day. This meant having to stay an extra night and extensive layover in MLB for their flight to NZ. On arrival, their luggage did not turn up. I feel very sorry for the crew having to explain and apologise for the delays and the inconvenience not of their doing. They were the saving grace in terms of their professionalism, friendliness and attentiveness on-board.

After complaining Airport staff found out it was still in Melbourne and never transferred to my flight to Singapore QF35 and Emirates did not receive it from Qantas in Singapore. To make things worse they kept postponed sending my luggage day by day and finally, I received it after 5 days. By then I had to cancel my trip to Kandy, buy new clothes for me as all my clothes in the luggage, and also hire a vehicle go back again to Colombo airport to pick my luggage and go through all the trouble as Colombo airport service was terrible. I spent two more weeks in Sri Lanka and kind of expecting some sort of compensation or at least a letter of apology from Qantas. I have experienced a similar trouble with Kuwait Airways and they were very fast in service recovery. But nothing from Qantas. When I came back to Auckland I sent my complaint to Qantas and to my surprise they keep passing the responsibility to Emirates which I flew from Singapore to Colombo. How could Emirates pick up my luggage in Melbourne which was under Qantas? I flew into Melbourne with Qantas and flew out of Melbourne with Qantas and It was Qantas who is responsible for transfering my luggage from QF158 to QF35. Unfortunately, Qantas customer services do not admit it's their fault. They not only ruined my holidays but also not giving reasons why my luggage was not transferred and why it was delayed 5days.

"""behaviour was inappropriate""","Santiago to Sydney. The behaviour of the in-flight crew on both flights was inappropriate, for different reasons. On the flight to Santiago, I at one stage went back to the service area to request more water for us both, saying words to the effect of ""Could I get more water for my partner and I?"". The female attendant then queried, ""Your mother?"". ""No, my wife"" I replied, at which she then said words along the lines of ""We were wondering if you two were a couple, my colleague asked me what my gaydar told me about you"". I found this statement to be inappropriately familiar and quite unprofessional. When I returned to my seat with the water, upon relating the exchange to my wife, the crew member suddenly appeared in front of us, saying ""Are you talking about me?"". Again, I found this behaviour odd and not a little bit creepy. Needless to say neither of us felt relaxed for the remainder of that flight. On the return flight, the female cabin member appeared put out by being asked for the slightest thing. We are not demanding passengers by any estimation, and are well aware that crew members have numerous duties to attend to. However, when the cabin member was walking past me, I attracted her attention and requested a drink for each of us. The reply was a deep and very audible sigh, followed by words to the effect of ""I'm very busy at the moment you know, I have the pilots' dinner to organise"". I stated that I understood, just when she got a chance. However, this ""you're so putting me out"" behaviour was repeated every time we asked for something or had a concern, such as when the lettuce was frozen solid, or when the pork was so tough I could not even cut it, let alone eat it (please see attached photos). On the subject of food, there is some expectation of edibility in all classes, let alone Business Class surely? I'm sure Neil Perry would not be pleased that his ""signature menu"" was so poorly executed. No one in that cabin had edible salad, all were frozen in one lump, and my ""replacement"" meal for the tough pork was beef that was not much better. I was left hungry as I could not eat either meal. When we requested some snacks due to being hungry, the male crew member said ""Oh you want to keep the chocolate? Well, you are a growing girl"". Again, to address a woman of 50 in such a way is not ""cute"" or ""friendly"", just odd. I would suggest that your staff need further training in not over-stepping the line between ""friendly"" and ""creepy"". In contrast, I have to say that your partner airline, Latam, which we flew for the remainder of our journey both ways, although not as ""fancy"" in terms of the seat/bed arrangement, were unfailingly friendly, helpful, and not once did we get the impression that we were an imposition to them, which was the impression we received from the crew member on the QANTAS flight. We have flown Business Class with Singapore, Lufthansa, and Emirates, and have been impressed and delighted every time with the helpfulness of the crew and the standard of the service and food. To be so disappointed, on two out of two occasions (congratulations, you have a perfect score), with our national carrier, was an unpleasant surprise, and has led us to the conclusion that, given any other choice, we will not fly QANTAS Business Class again.",1,1,Virginia Mena,2018-09-02,no,Business Class,Couple Leisure,Santiago to Sydney,July 2018,4,1,3,1,1,Qantas Airways

"""simply do not appear to care""","Singapore to Perth. Loyalty means nothing. After spending a considerable amount of time searching and planning for a 'suitable and available' flight where frequent flyer points could be used, (which I might add is no easy assignment) I booked the ticket, only to be emailed 3 weeks later advising the flight times from Singapore to Perth have been changed, with a new arrival time of 00:50. As we are based in Adelaide, this change now means we will be sitting in the airport overnight until the first flight out at 06:45. (I am empathetic to flight time changes and it is what it is), however my real gripe is that Qantas Customer Service (which is somewhat of an oxymoron) just simply do not appear to care about their loyal customers. I asked if I had any alternative options and suggested I would be happy to change our return flight to Melbourne, however this was promptly rejected without hesitation. To top it off, when I sent an email to Qantas voicing my disappointment and suggesting maybe a long standing loyal Frequent Flyer member may be provided with alternative options, I received a generic email response simply stating: ""Thank you for contacting Qantas Customer Care. For all pre-travel related queries, please contact our reservations team on 13 13 13. The team are available to assist 24 hours a day, 7 days a week"".

The iPad is much more responsive than other seat-mounted sets which get outdated very quickly. I was able to watch 3 films on the flight, all in good quality. The headsets they hand out leave a lot to be desired but they do suffice. (If you have your own, bring them as they'll fit the iPad). My meal was booked online before the flight so it was promptly brought out and was very tasty, and the ice cream and chocolate bar later in the flight were a very nice touch.

"""issue with deplaning""","Sydney To Brisbane. Everything started off fine, from Check-In to Lounge access and boarding. From there, it was a 30 minute delay because of baggage and cargo being loaded and the finalisation of paperwork. I don't understand why there are so many delays when they operate a wide body aircraft on domestic routes, something always come unhinged. The onboard service was good but it did not make up for the unnecessary delay. IFE was limited, not the best content by past experience. Once we landed into Brisbane, there was another issue with deplaning as we were delayed by another 10 minutes because the pilot couldn't park appropriately. By this time you can definitely tell a large number of passengers were getting irritated by the simple fact a trained pilot couldn't park a plane properly. I will fly Qantas, but if they can't sufficiently fly an A330 for domestic routes without consistency in schedule, just stick to the 737 as it's so much better this way plus it will free up a wide body aircraft for International routes.",1,5,P Huang,2018-07-17,no,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,Sydney to Brisbane,July 2018,4,3,4,3,3,Qantas Airways
"""disappointed with lunch""","Travelled on Qantas business class on 11/7/18 departed 1210pm from Melbourne to Brisbane. Dissatisfied and disappointed with lunch meal selection. The selection is either a potato leek soup, a sandwich or a salad that I think is not appropriate for substantial lunch. The reply I received from Qantas was also inadequate and dismissive. The reply was full of the airline promising high quality and variety of food and beverage selection but unfortunately they failed to deliver from my personal experience. I am wondering what they offer in their economy class for lunch if I did not travel in business class. Recently the airline has removed all music from IFE on tv screen or IFE app even on audio page still showing extensive selection of CD library from latest pop , jazz and rock to classic albums are available. So be prepared you need to BYO your music. Only Podcasts, talking business and kids audio books are available if you are interested in.

There is no wait line. If you try to call it is a good 30 minute wait, at least. To save money the airline has clearly cut back on essential website design, and staffing needed to help customers. In fact there is no phone number even listed on their website that I could locate. Folks we are talking about a seriously deficient airline, unable and unwilling to assist customers.

"""The seats were terrible""","Auckland to Melbourne. Rung up customer services prior to my trip to find out if my plane came with movies at the back of the seat or if I had to provide my own tablet as it was not very clear on their website. This was a simple quick question that wasn't a security risk, however the customer service person grilled me with many questions firstly my eticket, name, age, address, phone number, where I was going to, day etc. All she needed was my eticket number to check on that particular aircraft. All I wanted was to know if I needed to carry my tablet by hand and download the app. It was getting thoroughly annoying with all the questions that were not relevant so I asked for a supervisor. She would not put me through to someone unless I answered all questions. This really put my attitude towards Qantas at a 1/10 even before the flight. After over 10 minutes on the phone, I was finally told that I had movies. After all that, a positive outcome. Now the actual flight: Staff on the flight were very friendly and obliging.  The seats were terrible, the tiniest I have come across. The seat in front of me was pretty much at my knees and I'm only 5.7"". Now the trays for food, you couldn't even lay these flat, they are situated too low on the backs of the seats. So the meal was very uncomfortable. The food was very nice and a good size. However, even though a few good points, seat comfort is the most important and the attitude of the staff member prior to my flight has put me off every travelling Qantas again. I only took this flight (one way Auckland to Melbourne) as it was the earliest in the morning other than Virgin alliance with Air NZ and I didn't want to fly Virgin due to no meals and no entertainment.

Qantas Airways customer review,"Auckland to Brisbane. I used to always get acknowledged as a Frequent Flyer Gold member when flying but in the last six + flights I’ve had with Qantas from Australia to New Zealand and back I’ve noticed I’m not acknowledged anymore. It must only be Platinum members flying economy. That’s all good however you would also give me an express lane card to use when landing in Brisbane at night so I thought I’d mention that there isn’t an express lane at night so when I saw you giving them to Qantas frequent flyers I had to giggle imagining when they got off the plane. I can only imagine they are Platinum and above because I don’t get them anymore or get welcomed onto the plane like I used to. I flew last night and noticed a lady acknowledged the gentlemen in front of me then moved to my chair and I thought I’m getting welcomed back. She stopped, looked at me then moved to another man who was supposed to sit next to me but decided he wanted to move to an empty row for the space and went to him.  Maybe I don’t look like a frequent flyer which is ok too. Then the manager comes through acknowledges the man in front, stops by me and kept moving. I thought maybe he also forgot the man who moved too.

However before doing so I asked the Qantas staff at check in to check my ticket and to tell me if there would be individual entertainment (TVs) on this flight. They said there were. I told them that I had asked this question to the Qantas personnel in Sydney two weeks earlier and they had told me the same thing on a five hour flight from Sydney to Perth and they had been wrong. I specifically asked that they be sure as I would check my computer if that was the case. They told me that they were sure there would be individual TVs for all passengers on this flight. Needless to say there were not. The second flight in a row, with Qantas, within two weeks of each other, to or from Perth where they had specifically told me that there would be individual entertainment for passengers and there was not. Perth is a very isolated city. Every flight to or from Perth to the other major Australian cities takes a minimum of three hours. It is not unreasonable to believe that in asking, specifically, about in-flight entertainment one should be told up-front and accurately what type of flight they should expect.

"""seats seemed smaller and more cramped""","I booked a ticket via American Airlines for Qantas flights for a trip. I was flying from Cairns through Brisbane and Los Angeles to my final destination, San Diego. The flights were OK, nothing to rave about. The seats seemed smaller and more cramped other international flights I had taken. The food was too salty and lacked texture, but otherwise was fine. The attendants were kind and polite but a bit too strict when I asked for a drink (""Sir, you cannot have two drinks at the same time"" when I had about 1 or 2 sips in the bottom of the dinky cup, which I effortlessly finished on the spot). However, my main qualm with Qantas is with their ""Customer Care"" and agents and representatives. While I was in the air from Cairns to Brisbane, Qantas cancelled my flight from Brisbane to Los Angeles, and I received a notification when we touched down. Naturally, I was confused and annoyed - why did they cancel my long-haul flight and why didn't they tell me before I took off from Cairns? I called Qantas who said it was cancelled for ""operational requirements"" but I could take a flight the day after (wouldn't work with my schedule) or connect me through Sydney at a painfully early hour in the morning. However, I had to call American Airlines to actually book the seat. Since Qantas and American Airlines had literally zero communication and little to no knowledge of what was going on with my original flight (Qantas said they could not notify American Airlines and I had to call them), I had to spend about 4 phone calls and 2 hours on the phone trying to fix the issue. I eventually booked new flights that added about 12 hours of additional travel time. When I tried to speak to a representative on the ground at the Brisbane airport, he was incredibly unhelpful and curt (I'll cut him some slack - it was 4:30 am). He could not tell me why the flight was cancelled, could not file my complaints, and could not provide any information except ""Qantas has a process and the process works."" Well, I can tell you first hand that the process is extremely convoluted and difficult and does not actually work. I spent several weeks trying to reach Qantas ""Customer Care"" before I heard back. No resolution has been reached for a flight two months ago. Tip: skip the mess and reach out via Twitter.

We explained this extremely clearly and he said that, because Alaska are a Qantas partner, Qantas would take care of this for us in-air. Of course, this was false. We arrived in LAX with no connection information. Alaska was merciful and didn't charge us a re-booking fee, but that was their decision, not Qantas.

I had to have hard talk before they changed their mind and finally we were sent via Qantas. After reaching Sydney, we waited almost 1 hour with many other passengers and our baggage never arrived? We had to go and question Qantas staff and they said to lodge an entry with baggage services and we did it accordingly.

"""possibly the worst airline meal""","I flew QF72 from Singapore to Perth and the flight was extremely full (possibly due to the school holidays). Business class passengers were asked to board first (after families with young children) and this is probably not a good idea as passengers in economy have to file past and queue through the front cabin in this single aisle B737-800. It really is not a suitable aircraft for this very popular international route. After all passengers were seated we were offered a pre-departure drink, an amenities kit but no newspapers or cold/hot towels. Soon after take-off, drink and dinner orders were taken but the menu choices for business class took me by surprise - three seafood choices (fish dumpling soup, salmon salad or a prawn roll) with only one meat choice (pork) for main course. Entree was a choice of soup or chicken salad - I elected to have the chicken salad and it was very nice. Not being terribly keen on seafood, I chose the pork for main course, however, it had already run out (as was the case for another passenger) so I eventually chose the prawn and celery roll. It was served cold and possibly the worst airline meal I have ever eaten. Basically it was a hot-dog roll with a few chopped prawns scattered over the top - totally tasteless and inedible. Drinks were topped up from time to time during the meal service, however, more attention was given to passengers after the the meal service was completed which is totally understandable. As there is no division/curtain between business and economy there seems to be quite a lot of traffic through the forward cabin so there is little chance of taking a rest in these domestic style seats. Fortunately the passenger in front of me did not fully recline his seat as was the case on the Perth - Singapore sector earlier in the year. Overall, the crew did their very best to take care of passengers, however, as mentioned before, this small aircraft doesn't really seem appropriate for this very competitive and busy international sector. I sincerely hope Qantas considers the reinstatement of their A330's sometime in the future. In the meantime, the business class menu choices need to be urgently reviewed (as does a division/curtain between cabins).",1,7,D Chernoff,2018-04-28,yes,Business Class,Solo Leisure,Singapore to Perth,April 2018,3,2,5,4,3,Qantas Airways

I am not necessarily basing my review score on the delayed flight, as I know delays can sometimes happen. After boarding, I noticed each passenger had a pillow and blanket on their seat, however, on closer look at the pillow I noticed that it had been used previously - pillow slip was crumpled and was a little dirty and also, several long black hairs were attached. For me, this is simply unacceptable from an airline who believes it is a first class airline, a rung above most. The flight itself was fine. Drinks/meal service was acceptable.

The crew member was lovely though, I had a James Boag, I was offered another beer later and she remembered what I was drinking. Then came the Weis Mango & Cream bar along with KitKat which was some consolation even though they cost only about $1.50 in supermarket.

"""all cabin staff just disappeared""","QF2 flight from Dubai to Sydney. I took Emirates A380 in 2017 for the same route so good opportunity to compare Qantas and Emirates level of service. Since the flight ticket was more expensive I was expecting something nice. First deceptions came as soon as I sat in my seat: reduced room for legs, no USB plug to recharge my phone, small screen with very few interesting movies, meal rests and hairs on my tablet, and no glass holder on the back seat so you are compelled to have the tablet on your knees to put the glass on it. The boarding started an hour earlier than expected which explains why the plane was looking so dirty inside, they probably did not clean it at all despite the plane staying at least 3 hours on the Dubai tarmac. As a result, the boarding was finished one hour earlier than departure time, so we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited, three hours in the plane before takeoff. No green light given by the control tower apparently. As soon as the ascent was done the staff started to get the meals ready and it took them 1 hour for them to get ready with the meals. I somehow had the impression that it was the first flight for the entire cabin crew. Another hour and a half before finally receiving a meal to eat which was OKish but the portion size and meal quality were below Emirates standards. I enquired with the staff about the next time a meal would be served in order to know when I could sleep he said ""I dunno, but you'll get some snacks in a couple of hours"". Yeah, nobody saw any snacks coming during the entire flight, then all cabin staff just disappeared, I have not seen a single one of them during 9 hours. Probably all went to sleep at the same time (very smart move in case there is an emergency). At some point during the flight the sound of the TV stopped functioning for my neighbors and me. The crew came to check and quickly left by saying ""sometimes things just go bad"". Great. I then took the opportunity to look at the entire cabin configuration and it actually looked pretty depressing. Black seats, non-led lightning, damaged trolleys. Emirates does a much better job here with night sky rooftops and dimmed led lighting. After more than 9 hours without eating anything I started to feel pretty bad so I was happy to see the crew preparing the second meal of the flight (note: there were 3 meals on Emirates + 2 snacks) but again they were completely disorganized and it took them ages to get ready and serve everybody. My meal was almost cold when I received it, again it was OKish but I just needed to eat something otherwise I would have fainted so I ate it, and the portion size was still bigger than if I would have taken the alternative: an apple.

An hour before we land, I asked for another Evian bottle of water (500ml size) and was told that each passenger has one only and if I wanted more water then she has to bring my empty bottle to the galley to be topped up with bottled water. Are you telling me that all the money and points we paid for the flight, Qantas cannot afford to give their First Class passengers more than 1 bottle of Evian water? And how confident am I to believe that it was topped up with ""bottled water"" - not!

They were at the Melbourne airport at 6.00 am ready to go. That plane had air condition problems and they had to fly a plane from Sydney for them to change to so they were about 5 hours late. I flew to Perth on another airline no probs at all and arrived early. Some of my workers were coming back to Melbourne on the 1.30 pm flight and it was delayed for 45 min. Myself and one of my workers were booked on the 3.00 pm flight to arrive back in Melbourne. There was a message that the plane cabin temperature was too hot so we could not board until it was cool - how does that happen. Then about to board and one of the crew members came off sick and we all had to sit down again until they found a replacement crew member. (Not sure why all that happened after the air conditioning issue. Then we finally boarded and everyone was on and they sat us there in a very hot plane for about another 20 min and the ipad movie pods were not working. Plane finally got off the ground at 4.30 pm. It is the flow on that they do not see. It meant my workers had done too many hours so I had to give them today (Following day) off. So the project we were supposed to be finishing today has to be re scheduled for next week. People on the plane did not seem to mind so much but as I knew there had been 3 bad planes in two days that all affected me and my work I had to say something.

After dinner the lights went out and the curtain came across the galley, not once during the 9.5 hour trip were we asked if we wanted water or anything - we are the type that does not like using the call button - breakfast was very basic, a squashed up ham and cheese croissant or cereal and fruit, no hot breakfast - most economy flight breakfasts are better , the B747 is showing it's age with noisy airconditioning and tired toilets, flight was on time but service should have been much better, I will stick to economy in future - especially as I pay for the flights myself.",1,6,Ken Parsons,2018-03-22,yes,Premium Economy,Couple Leisure,Tokyo to Sydney,March 2018,3,2,4,1,3,Qantas Airways

One hour before landing given a frozen fruit juice ice block labelled ""made in China"". From an airline that rests on Aussiecentric marketing. At descent, offered a chocolate of a brand known to taste like soap. So nothing appealing to eat in over 4.5 hours. No seat back entertainment. Overhead screens glarey and barely visible, showing some superhero movie. Why is it you can fly Sydney - Melbourne and get unnecessary seat back entertainment often but never on a 4.5 plus hour flight to DRW.

Had a long layover as was waiting for QF9 and a colleague travelling from Melbourne so made the most of the excellent lounge.

The sector from LA to Sydney in PE was just as good as the flights outbound. I managed to get just on 8 hours of sleep which I have struggled to do on any long haul flight.

"""found the experience humiliating""","Sydney to Wellcamp. Dash 8-400 Turboprop Flight about two thirds full. Two male cabin crew one very efficient and friendly, the ""supervising"" male extremely rude and unpleasant. I would like to seek clarification on a few statements and expectations made by the head of the cabin crew on our flight on the 17th January from Sydney to Wellcamp Toowoomba. Three of us had travelled to and from Perth on business. With only 20 minutes to transfer from one flight to the other, I had purchased three steamed dim sums from the Sydney terminal café precinct. I carried them onto the plane and our team shared them mid-flight when the cheese and biscuits had been distributed by the cabin crew. I had placed the plastic container and the wrappings from the snacks supplied by the crew in a small plastic bag (the one I had carried the three dim sums onto the flight in). When the rubbish was being collected by the cabin crew after all on the flight had finished eating, the cabin team leader said “I will not be collecting the garbage you have brought onto the flight. We have limited space, you will have to keep it on your lap and take it off the flight with you. If there is any room in our trash once I have finished cleaning the cabin, then and only then, will I remove it.” He then walked off leaving the rubbish with me. I was left dumbfounded, wondering what I had done to offend the man. The flight was two thirds full. I was seated in seat 8B beside a large gentleman and, as I am 105 Kg myself, mid-flight I changed seats to the third row from the front where the whole row was empty. Five minutes later the same cabin crew member asked me to return to my original seat. I explained I was cramped with two large men in the one row and that the 8 or so seats around me were vacant so what harm could it cause? The cabin crew member said in a stern voice. “I’m instructing you to move back to your assigned seat.” I said “I have been using QANTAS for 30 years and had never been told that I could not move seats after take-off especially when so many were vacant.” he responded, “The flight needs to be balanced” I said, “when I checked in online there were numerous seats all over the plane that were vacant, I could have picked any one of them, how did you determine who weighs what and then decide where they should sit?” he said, “Return to your assigned seat immediately!” and walked off abruptly. Again I was left shaking my head in disbelief and so were the other passengers on the plane. A number of whom urged me to make a complaint about the cabin crew members rudeness. I now find myself writing my first ever letter of complaint. Can you tell me the QANTAS policy on bringing food and by association, the wrappings onto a flight? Can you clarify the QANTAS policy on moving seats when a cramped situation can be overcome by the relocation of a passenger?

Oh, and another other couple on our tour was still waiting for luggage that Qantas lost two days prior - different flight. Our tour driver said it happens all the time; she hears this from customers and it's always Qantas. Heard this from our hotel as well. Terrible customer service.

"""disorganised and unprofessional attitude""","I would not recommend flying with Qantas. This is a company that use to pride itself on safety and service. They charged me more than $10000 for a return flight for two people from San Francisco to Sydney. At that rate you would expect that they would do everything possible to ensure that you are comfortable throughout your flight. Instead, they forced my partner and I to move from the pre-assigned seats we had checked into 9hours before the flight was due. They did not give us a choice nor did they give us an adequate explanation. The seats we were moved to were cramped and the entertainment system did not work. Moving seats prior to a long flight when you had completely settled in and are about to fall asleep an hour after checking in is not only rude and frustrating but had completely ruined the end to my holiday. When I called to give feedback they requested a feedback form and informed that they would return my call within 3 days. 2 weeks later I had not received a call and when I called the staff member was dismissive and unhelpful to say the least. She was unable to provide any explanation for why I was moved. Not only that, she offered an insincerely apology and 10000 frequent flyer points.

The seat pitch was more than sufficient for me (at more than 180 cm in height), particularly onboard the A330, the depth of recline was acceptable, with the moving seat pan serving to minimise the inconvenience caused to and by other passengers. I found features such as the adjustable headrests and USB ports useful, the fact that these were present onboard the B737s as well makes them all the more impressive. The service onboard was sincere, with all requests attended to promptly and courteously. The cabin crew were attentive and conducted regular refreshment and rubbish collection runs through the cabin. Only minor touches such as newspapers and amenity kits were absent. The quality of the meals served (lacto-ovo vegetarian) ranged from good (breakfast on the flights to and from Christchurch) to excellent (all other meals), with the staggered delivery of courses (i.e. rather than on a single tray) and inclusion of snacks in the meal service allowing for some flexibility. A larger selection of mid-flight snacks would have been appreciated, though, given the rather small portions. The connections at Brisbane and Sydney were seamless, when the already-short connection at Brisbane was exacerbated by a delay in the flight from Singapore, airline employees were deployed at frequent intervals along the route between the two gates to guide passengers and expedite the transit process.

"""disappointed with the experience""","Dubai to Melbourne. My Emirates flight was operated by Qantas. I was very disappointed with the experience. First, the meals are substandard for a long international flight as they only served one hot meal just before landing. The chicken wrap and the pizza boxes were the worst food I ever ate on a plane. Second, it was so cold inside the plane and their blankets were thin. They keep running out of things. I dont know if it is because of my seating but i never received enough drinks or complete food as they kept running out when they got to my row. Fourth, the entertainment options are very limited and entertainment controls like remote and headphone jack were uncomfortable to use.",1,2,S Keehan,2018-01-31,no,Economy Class,Family Leisure,Dubai to Melbourne,January 2018,2,1,1,3,1,Qantas Airways
"""light load and plenty of space""","Sydney to Los Angeles. A trip to LA on Qantas and the Boeing 747-400 . This leaves at 6.25 pm as QF17 and gets in at 1.30pm on the same day. A superb time to arrive as QF11 (which I prefer as its the A380) gets in at 6 am and just a pain unless you have booked a hotel room for the night before also. It was a light load and so plenty of space. Usual QF standards of food ie satisfactory. The FA's were professional and friendly. The B747 was/is a great aircraft but its showing its age. The A380 style seating does lift it a bit although the seats themselves look a bit smaller than on the Airbus. The washrooms are well used! One notices the noise levels the most compared to the Airbus but it is a plane designed in the 60's. On time departure and arrival; the immigration lines at LAX were very light, automated entry and out into the taxi to LA within around an hour of leaving the aircraft. In summary, Qantas it is time to move the 747 to the old folks home.",1,8,Neil Jeram,2018-01-29,yes,Economy Class,Business,Sydney to Los Angeles,January 2018,3,4,4,4,4,Qantas Airways

Amenities include a water bottle, pillow, blanket and earphones. No fixed headrest onboard. Cabin crew announcements were clear. They are fairly attentive and friendly. The inflight meal choices are chicken salad, vegetarian eggplant masala with rice and naan, beef brisket withg polenta. All meals come with warm and soft garlic bread. I chose the beef brisket. The vegetables were overcooked but the polenta was delicious. The beef brisket is cooked to perfection, soft, tender and almost divine, if you pair it with a bottle of shiraz or merlot!

Cabin Crew were attentive before and after takeoff, and during the meal service, constantly keeping an eye to see if anyone needed further assistance. The Customer Service Manager genuinely welcomed me, along with other passengers during the flight. Definitely a step up from some of my previous Business Class experience.

""" dismissive and unapologetic""","Melbourne to Orlando via Sydney / Dallas. My wife and I booked flights from Melbourne to Orlando in December 2017. During our travel to and from the final destination with Qantas and its partner airlines we were met with a disheartening and unacceptable number of delays, errors, cancellations, and general lack of respect and care from the service members we reached out to for help. Lack of time provided by Qantas for connecting flight in Dallas resulting in a high probability of missing the connecting flight. Flight from Sydney to Dallas left more than an hour late, causing us to miss our connecting flight from Dallas to Orlando. New flights were issued which which added an additional hours and an additional flight and wait times to finally arrive in Orlando.  We called and spoke to Qantas and the staff on the phone were extremely unhelpful and misinformed us and advised that there were no other options. Instead we spoke to the staff in the airport who were able to find a more convenient flight for us. Our flight from Sydney to Melbourne was changed by Qantas in error from December 2017, to March 2018. This was discovered by us, and not Qantas. We then has to contact Qantas to have this corrected. Flights home from Orlando to Los Angeles was delayed, and ground staff advised that this would not impact our flight from Los Angeles to Sydney. When we arrived in Los Angeles we found that this did in-fact impact our flight. The ground staff checked our names and rushed us to another gate as the next flight was about to leave, only to find we had not been placed on this flight. We were then sent to another gate where they advised the flight was delayed by 5 hours, leaving at 3am. After waiting, the flight was delayed further to 4am As a result of these constant delays, we missed our flight from Sydney to Melbourne, and were instead placed on a flight much later - leaving us stuck in Sydney airport for 3 more hours. In Sydney we attempted to seek support from the Qantas service desk but they were dismissive and unapologetic. Note that during this entire experience we had to contact Qantas, as no one contacted us to advise of any of the unexpected changes, delays and cancellations. While I understand that there are factors outside of your control, and occasional delays are inevitability, the errors made by Qantas and the general lack of communication, support, and disrespect from staff members is unacceptable.",1,1,P Burmen,2018-01-17,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,Melbourne to Orlando via Sydney / Dallas,December 2017,2,2,1,4,2,Qantas Airways

"""seat had very little legroom""","I flew QF38 from Singapore to Melbourne in Economy only because Emirates (which code-shares with Qantas) was full. The evening meal was so below par - a ""Calzone"" (more like a stuffed bun, about 3"" long) was served in a cardboard box! I would have done better to have purchased a sandwich from the airport to eat onboard - and this is a Full-service airline of some repute! Compared to Emirates or Singapore Airlines, this meal was a real shocker! Even the meals offered by China Southern Airlines were so much better than Qantas' offering. Breakfast was at least the usual rubber omelette with bacon and sausage. It appears the wines accompanying the evening meal were very average, but at least they were Australian. But the coffee (Grinders) and tea (Dilmah) offered were quite good. On the plus side, it was a nice touch that every Economy seat had a small bottle of water (about 250ml) in the seat pocket. Actually, that saves the crew some legwork from having to repeatedly answer passenger requests for water as longer flights like these can make one quite dehydrated, The seat had very little legroom, and it was virtually impossible to find a comfortable position to sleep, especially when the passenger in front had their chair in the fully reclined position virtually all the way. Cabin service, while courteous, was almost non-existent. Unlike many of its major competitors, no refresher towels pre-takeoff and landing, no drinks offered after takeoff, only with the meal service. Despite being an overnight flight, no ""goodie"" bag containing eyeshades, toothbrush and socks were given, unlike SQ or EK. Entertainment was adequate but the screens were quite small, and not very responsive to the touch. I was quite disappointed with Qantas. Usually, I book Qantas but would always select Emirates planes (if available), which offers much more legroom, especially on their A380s.

"""The service was professional""","Perth to Singapore on 4 January and as my ticket was purchased at the last moment and at this peak time, the fare was quite expensive (it was the same for all airlines and in all classes). I was a little worried that business class on this 737-800 aircraft which is used mainly for domestic and regional flights would be up to scratch on this international flight but the service was impeccable. Addressed by name, I was offered a pre-departure champagne and an amenities kit. Soon after take-off drinks were served, a menu provided and my order taken. The meal was excellent, the choices were good with an excellent variety of wines. The service was professional, courteous and continuous. The only complaint was that the person in front of me reclined their seat back about 1 minute after take-off and kept it in that position for the entire flight. The flight attendant, however, did ask if I wanted the passenger to put their seat upright during the meal service (this is a problem on this type of aircraft with these non-capsule seats). Another small concern is that there is no division or curtain between business and economy other than a small screen above the rear seats in business class. In fact, these rear business seats recline into the economy cabin as there is no bulkhead (but there is plenty of room to recline). Overall, this was a magnificent flight, excellent service and I wouldn't hesitate to fly this route again and on this type of aircraft. Of course my personal preference would be to bring back the A330's for this international service.",1,9,D Chernoff,2018-01-15,yes,Business Class,Solo Leisure,Perth to Singapore,January 2018,3,5,5,5,3,Qantas Airways

"""they failed spectacularly""","Sydney to Johannesburg. The business cabin is really starting to show it’s age - seats need a really good steam clean  or to be overhauled and replaced with more up to date units. Entertainment options are good. Qantas often makes a song and dance of their Rockpool inspired dining, but overall food was awful. The menu was pedestrian and did not deliver - the person across the aisle from me sent his meal back. Fillet steak was grey throughout, the prawn starter was bland, and the panna cotta was weirdly goopy and overly sweet. The dinner menu was not much better with limited options that seemed worse than the previous offerings. I get that’s its airline food, but if you’re going to do it this badly then maybe it’s time to rethink your value proposition. The option to dine when suits you is all over the website, but the staff seem constantly overwhelmed so good luck trying to get any of the extra care and attention one would expect in the business cabin. Wine selection is extensive and might have made up for some of the lack lustre food performance, but good luck getting a glass of anything with staff being unable to handle the cabin size. If you do ask for anything they seem visibly annoyed. Normally there are snacks (sandwiches, fruit, etc.) available throughout the flight, and seeing as the meal options were so awful it would have been nice to try eat something else, but this was not offered by the attendants and the idea of requesting something seemed like a bad idea as asking for a glass of wine earns one a dirty look.

"""seat pitch of 30"" isn't adequate""","Perth to Singapore. This flight was an Emirates code-share operated by Qantas. I tried to check in online so that I could get an aisle seat, the Emirates website directed me to the Qantas website, which as a code-share would not allow me to check in. So I fronted to the airport check-in counter (no kiosks available) 3 hours before the flight, was about the 5th passenger checked in, and was told the last available seat was a window seat (my boarding pass had sequence number 45). I had a pass to the Qantas Lounge, valid for ""Qantas flight number""; my boarding pass said ""Flight QF77"" but the staff at the lounge refused to honour the lounge pass, claiming ""your fare went to Emirates"" - a spurious argument indeed considering the lounge pass was issued by my bank! Onboard, my confirmed special meal request had not been catered - fortunately one of the standard offerings was suitable. The aircraft looked band new, seat pitch of 30"" isn't adequate for a 5+ hour international flight, but at least this was the 29-row layout (the 30-row layout must be intolerable). Thinking about it, of all the airlines operating this route only Jetstar gives less leg room. Movie system was a new touch-screen system, but the selection was pretty ordinary, and the sound kept breaking up.

"""comfortable seats, and plenty of space""","Flew Brisbane to Johannesburg via Sydney. Early 4.30am check in in Brisbane, and surprised by number of passengers checking in for international connections - even more surprised by passengers checking in at 04.30 for 05.00 flights. Whereas Qantas could have taken the standpoint that passengers were too late, they actively managed the queue to ensure the late passengers made their flight. We were on a 06.30 flight so checked in for our connecting flights with no problem. Our flight left on time, and we were advised that flying time to Sydney would be only 60 minutes. Despite turbulence for the first 15 minutes, a full breakfast service was provided, with a choice of bacon and vegetable pie or a continental breakfast comprising yoghurt, banana muffin and cereal snack bar. Worth noting that the yoghurt was top quality. Boarding for the main flight was a different story. Renovations are in progress, so the departure lounge was very small, and a 30 minute delayed boarding resulted in much congestion, with no attempt to manage the situation. The lounge was packed resulting in lots of people waiting in the corridor. It was an eye opener to see the number of passengers boarding at the premier check in who considered they were exempt from queuing and were entitled to push in at the front. Boarding once started proceeded efficiently and we were soon settled with a glass of champagne, and from then on the service was superb. Qantas premium economy on the 747 is excellent. A small cabin, comfortable seats, and plenty of space. On this particular aircraft there was a bathroom within the premium economy cabin, which is a big plus.

"""a miserable long trip""","I had a miserable long trip from Sydney to Dallas. I was in the back row of the top part of an A380, seat 36F. There were three ladies in that row, myself included. We put the magazines from the net pocket in the top storage as there was no leg room whatsoever. All night my knees were pushed against the seat and the temperature was like a meat cooler. When the people in the row in front of us put their seats back, we were cramped beyond belief. I was on the aisle but the lady two seats over had a wall beside her and had great difficulty getting in and out of the row with the seats in front laid back. God help her if there were an emergency. I had an extra blanket in my carry-on that I wrapped around my legs and used the blanket they gave us on my torso doubled. I wore three shirts layered and used their blanket and was still cold all night. I couldn't sleep - which is unusual as I can sleep easily on most planes. In the morning people were complaining about the cold and rubbing their hands and arms so others felt the cold. Dinner was so awful, I only ate the bun, and small square of potatoes and the chocolate pudding. The broccoli/kale was burnt and tasted awful, the chicken was chewy and jellylike. I only had one bite. I suspected it either wasn't real meat or wasn't cooked properly. I was hungry in the night but I wouldn't exactly waste away so just endured. I was offered a chili cheese dog in the night but it smelled awful. The lady beside my had the lasagna and did not eat it either. In the morning, people were choosing the yogurt/fruit option. I don't think anyone wanted more cooked options from this flight. When we got on, The couple beside us on the wall - each had a glass of wine and the couple in front of them also each had a glass of wine. Then they were served a second glass of wine and the cart moved forward. When our row was finally asked - the attendant just said ""Do you want chicken or lasagna?"" I told her chicken and then asked her if there was there a reason we were not offered a cocktail as the couples beside us were on their second"" She said ""Oh it was the lady's birthday and the other couple are newlyweds going home from their honeymoon"". Then she asked if I wanted a cocktail and I said ""Well I would have liked one twenty minutes ago when they got their second one but not now when I have my food"". The sarcasm was totally lost with her and she just said ok and moved on. We got on the flight about 3:30 pm and dinner was all done and cleaned up by about 6:00 pm. It was like the staff just wanted to get it over with and by 7:00 pm, lights went down and so did the temperature. They have a big long fancy menu but you are not offered even half of the items. In Nov. I had flown Toronto to UK, to South Africa, to Sydney, to Melbourne, back to Sydney, to Dallas and to Fort Meyers, FL, I had seen lots of economy seats and none were this close or uncomfortable or cold. The couple right beside the exit door in the two seats along the wall looked well into their seventies. It wasn't the most comforting thought that they were in charge of opening the emergency door. The staff were distant - not friendly. Maybe the plane is just too big and it becomes a chore for them but it didn't feel as if they enjoyed their job.

Instead, the arrangements to bring guests this person on board and requesting the person to arrive a few minutes earlier could have saved time.

"""the worst airline of the year""","Dubai to Sydney via Melbourne. I had a very disappointing experience with Qantas. Due to circumstances we wanted to change our flight form Darwin – Adelaide. Online we got a message “contact the office”. So we tried to telephone 131313. We placed three calls: the first one being 37 minutes, the second one being 20 minutes and the third one more than 40 minutes but we never got anybody on the line, only some completely ridiculous ever repeating message. So we purchased some internet time, and we tried the “chat”. It worked. But in the end the person could not help because there was a small fee involved, and he could not handle financial transactions. He advised us to contact either an office or by telephone. Contacting an office Friday at 9PM in Alice Springs is certainly not evident. And telephoning not possible. So service of Qantas is zero, nothing. We solved the problem by booking a flight Alice Springs-Darwin by Virgin Australia. 2. I don’t think anybody of the Management has ever travelled in economy class. The food is bad. On our flight Dubai-Melbourne we got as breakfast (after a flight of 11 hours) a small box containing cereals and some milk. Bread? Eggs? Fruit? On the similar flight Adelaide to Dubai operated by Emirates, we even got a choice of eggs, we got fruit, we got bread. On the flight Darwin-Adelaide we got as lunch a small box containing some Asian food. Nothing else. Honestly, the smallest roadside shop sells 10 times better food than this. It was simply disgusting,Drinks have to be paid for! On the flight by Virgin Australia we got a decent lunch and free drinks. Qantas have no official site where one can make complaints, and E-mail messages are not replied to, maybe somewhere next year – who knows.

Once under way service was excellent, bar service with meal quickly following. Choice of two meals, including a beef stir fry which was very good. Good wines and attentive service throughout the meal. By this time my wife was asleep and slept for over 8 hours. She woke up once and the attendant produced a very tasty snack for her. The 747 is perhaps showing signs of age and is significantly noisier than the A380, but it is still a great aircraft. The small premium economy cabin is very pleasant, but so much depends on the crew who were top rate. Overall the premium economy service is good, and offers a lot of advantages, not the least of which is the lack reduction in queues and hassles.

So the result was that I just had a piece of bread and butter for lunch - in Business Class.

Qantas made the situation very easy by putting my reservation to their 11:15 departure for Auckland. The Business Lounge was very busy, though being a 11:15 departure that was inevitable. Still, the Lounge had great food and beverages including very attentive staff members. The flight at times was quite turbulent, it affected the timing of meals being served and the overall schedule of the Cabin Crew. The service was definitely quick pace, but I felt the Crew did it with great professionalism and poise without making everything a rush.

It's just not as simple as at Dallas FW which is my preferred route to get to NY. The B747 from LAX to JFK has seen better days. Still comfortable to ride in but very noisy in comparison and one that is overdue for retirement.

But the seating comfort and full flat bed comfort was fine. One major issue of this travel was the toilet availability.

"""staff at Qantas Club were helpful""","Brisbane to Christchurch return. Return leg via Sydney. Used the recently refurbished Qantas Business Lounge at Brisbane Airport. A real sanctuary compared with its former self. The attendants on the mezzanine level were friendly, offering hot breakfast options, to make coffee, and assist in any way. Qantas have done well in improving service here. Boarding was quick enough and hassle free. Landed in Christchurch on time and bags on the belt within 10 minutes. My bag was premium tagged and was fourth bag on the belt. Christchurch to Brisbane via Sydney on return was a day of flying I'd rather forget. Our flight to Sydney was delayed by over four hours due to fog at Christchurch and the aircraft being diverted to Auckland for fuel and waiting for fog to lift. As I had an onward connection in Sydney, I inquired at the gate desk with a well rehearsed reply from the gate agent, ""when you get to Sydney, it will be all sorted, someone will be waiting for you at the gate."" Of course, this was not the case, but I did learn that Qantas at Christchurch is contracted and apart from getting passengers on planes, they cannot do much more for you. It was interesting to note that Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 suffered the same fate. Over the PA was announced, ""Singapore Airlines apologises for the delay due to fog etc, we have $20 vouchers for food and beverages."" Qantas passengers were not afforded any such appreciation, and who I might add, had been waiting far longer than Singapore Airlines passengers. Once the Qantas aircraft arrived from Auckland, things seemed to move quicker and soon enough boarding and on the plane. Once departed from Christchurch, the service on board was excellent.  The food was good and there were a couple of water runs on this three hour flight. This flight, albeit late was one of the better ones I have had with Qantas. Once in Sydney, I had a Qantas agent phone me, while still taxiing to the international terminal advising my original flight had been cancelled and I was rebooked onto a 7pm flight to Brisbane. This was so much later than my original 11.30am arrival into Brisbane. As I had a bag checked, I had to take the flight as it was the only one available. The Qantas agent appeared to want to help but could not give me an earlier flight due to unavailability. So, after rechecking my bag through to Brisbane on this later flight, I proceeded to Sydney Domestic and waited in the Qantas Club for the hours to pass by. Thankfully a PA announcement requesting passengers from later flights to go on a 4.30pm flight was announced. I took this up. The Qantas staff at the Qantas Club were helpful but I feared that by changing my flight, my bag would not change with it. Sure enough, after arriving Brisbane, my bag was still in Sydney. Bag was delivered a day later. It was just a day of mishaps, but I was happy with each of the Qantas staff I dealt with.",0,8,David Dale,2017-04-12,yes,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,Brisbane to Christchurch,April 2017,4,5,5,5,4,Qantas Airways

Overall seats are comfortable however and it may be me when fully reclined I found the seams dig in to my hips making sleep a challenge. They need a bit more padding. Service in both directions was excellent. Cabin staff were attentive. On return journey from Dubai to LHR I received probably the best in-flight service of the past 5 years flying. I am Emerald OneWorld and a frequent flyer.  The food on both journeys was very good, and plenty of choice. Would have preferred more choice of fruit and this seemed limited on the aircraft travelling out of Dubai. Drink selection in particular wine was excellent. Only gripe was the switch at Dubai and getting on and off the aircraft, clearing security again is a hassle. Also the timing of the flight is not ideal from a sleep and managing jet lag.

"""at the bottom of the list""","Los Angeles to Perth via Brisbane. We did encounter one leg with average service; my husband’s morning coffee was served spilt, a few napkins shoved underneath to absorb the mess, basically half a cup of coffee, and no sugar (as requested) – a quick apology was given, but it really shouldn’t have been served this way and accompanied by a cold serve of scrambled eggs. Not a bad run, considering we flew four legs in total. Overall, the meals were pretty good. Of all the Business Class experiences we have had (Etihad, Emirates, Virgin, Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines), our Qantas experience has landed at the bottom of the list. On our return leg, we had booked row 3 seats in the nose of the plane (747), weeks in advance. A last minute aircraft change saw us separated, so a customer service rep via social media offered us two back row business class seats – the last remaining together apparently – we reluctantly accepted. The very next morning I logged in to check seating again and noticed the aircraft had reverted back to the original. I messaged our social media friend to obtain our existing seats, only to be told ‘bad luck’. Our seats were gone, and we weren’t getting them back. I protested a number of times only to be hit with ‘cut and paste’ replies on operational aircraft change jargon. Eventually, they just ignored me. I also sent a complaint via Qantas online and recently received the same ‘cut and paste’ response about aircraft change. In all honestly, they could have just given our original seats back and kept us happy, considering the above was all within a 24-hour window. The reason we wanted row 3, was that those Business Class seats (FYI) are in the nose of the plane and more spaced / private. We flew over in row 2 and enjoyed the experience. The second part of the 747 is where the seats are 2-3-2. Basically, a very ‘Premium Economy’ experience albeit your bed lies flat. You don’t have a feeling of personal space and can easily bump your neighbour getting in and out of your seating. Two of our legs, we’re flown in an A330; this is a much better aircraft for Business Class, with seating 1-2-1 for personal space, and a nice big entertainment screen on the front seat, as opposed to the small pull out ones on the 747. Unfortunately though, the A330 aircraft cannot be used for long haul flights. Based on the above experience, and at a cost of $20,000 for the return trip, we will not be flying Qantas again for our next journey in June. We have already sourced an alternate airline. I believe our seating error could have been handled better. Unfortunately, we are not Platinum members, so I feel we were overlooked and brushed aside.  Had our original seating, which was booked weeks in advance been honoured, we would have rebooked with Qantas in June.  Do not change your seats with aircraft changes until check in. And, do not rely on Qantas social media customer service.

They actually make an effort to welcome you, chat with you, make sure your children are settled before you take off. Firstly, they have cost cut to the point of it being ridiculous. No basic amenities such as a toothbrush and a few pencils for my daughter to play with (unless asked). Service is unfriendly and rude. The amount of packaging for their food is huge - rubbish everywhere. They don't use a tray to serve you so you need to juggle individual bits of food on your little table. The food quality is poor - my salad was gritty and the greens were slimy. No walking through the cabin offering water in the middle of the night - you have to track it down. We have been fortunate to have bulkhead seats on 2/3 trips however the seat room is shocking - you would need to be under 160cm to fit.

After 1.5 hours on the plane we were told we would have to deplane We were given a 20 dollar voucher but only one cafe to spend it in, so the queue was enormous. The business lounge was reopened but very little food was available until lunchtime. No information was forthcoming, eventually our brother in law in Sydney told us that it was showing on the computer that the flight was leaving at 1540 but we had not been told this. Eventually it got round that it would now be 1640 but still nothing official to business class passengers - if announcements were made outside they were not conveyed to us. Eventually a woman told us at 3.00 pm that the flight was cancelled - no empathy, no real apology just that we had to reclaim our baggage and recheck in. No announcement was made where our baggage would be and no sign appeared on the belt, and eventually it appeared on a domestic carousel. Eventually we were called out of the queue and told we would be put on Emirates flight. For the first time the attitude was more appropriate.

What are Qantas doing? Either you fly Jetstar for the supposed budget end, or Qantas for full service. Food was chronic. People lined up like sheep at the toilet at the rear, whilst they were not allowed to use the business class toilet, as that was for the six or seven pax in business. That was understandable, as they had paid the princely sum of around $1700 return for a seat little better than those horrible European business class offers.

If we'd had sufficient points for all flights, we would have had to fly Jetstar via Melbourne. How stupid and inconvenient is that?

The automated call back service seems to be non existent as not once were any of those calls answered. Qantas simply refuses to employ sufficient staff. My numerous emails were also ignored. The $60 we paid for advance seat allocation was non refundable.  Regarding food, on two occasions between Brisbane and Singapore, the meal we wanted had run out. It seems that the caterers assume that most passengers will be Asian, therefore two of the three choices are spicy Asian dishes.

"""should match the expectation""","Sydney to London via Dubai in Premium Economy. I’ve traveled in PE before on Qantas and it’s been underwhelming. On the last occasion and this time, I used QFF points to upgrade from Economy, but no matter how you get there PE is an expensive jump in cost and in the past, it’s not lived up to the hype. This time was different and service was impeccable.  There were frequent drinks top ups and constant attention to detail. I was pleasantly surprised with the food and drink for the most part. Wine was served from full size bottles of decent brands and the dinner out of Sydney was excellent. I’ve heard people say that Premium Economy food is the same as Economy but in this instance the dishes on Q-Eat were I think different between the two classes – I had ordered on both – before and after the upgrade. Anyway, it was a very nice dinner service with all the trimmings served on white linen and felt like a premium service. The seat is not too bad, it’s wide with lots of leg room and I managed a few hours of sleep up to Dubai. For solo travelers 24A and 24K are the best seats, window seats on the exit row. The blankets, pillows and headphones are the same as Business Class and you share the rear Business Class bathrooms. The only disappointment was the strange supper dish served before landing in Dubai, it was an egg roll with an accompanying chicken sausage. It was really not at all nice but I ate it as I was hungry by now. Then to the second leg out of Dubai and it soon became evident that this leg would be back to the Premium Economy that I remembered from the past, so Y Class with a tablecloth. The cabin crew were nice enough but it was not the same level of service. After what seemed like quite a time after take-off they came around with a supper service of hot sandwiches which were OK, but it seemed like only coffee or tea or juice was loaded on the trolley. This was in the middle of the night out of Dubai at the start of a night leg into London, who wants coffee at that time? Me and many of the people around me asked for a glass of wine or similar. That was met with a call back to the galley and a small bottle of economy wine was given to each. When the trays were cleared no more drinks were offered, though I guess you could request them. That was pretty much it for that crew until two hours before landing when they served a substantial hot and cold breakfast and then they were done. So hot towels like the first leg, either on decent or after take-off, really just Y service with a tablecloth. The crew were nice enough but some of them need to be reminded that PE is an expensive seat and the service level should match the expectation of a ticket costing two or three times the cost of Economy.",0,9,A Kramer,2016-12-05,yes,Premium Economy,Solo Leisure,SYD to LHR via DXB,November 2016,4,4,5,5,3,Qantas Airways

The new layout in the reconfigured Boeing 747 is very tight up front and there is little room to navigate your way to washrooms when people are sleeping. The staff were less than impressive in my cabin they seemed more interested in some friends or family than the paying clients. Qantas does this thing where its late at night after the poor lounge experience all you would like is a snack before you sleep, 2.5 hours after take off they begrudgingly offer you something to eat. I always thought American Airlines was terrible, but my last several flights on them have far exceeded my Qantas experience.

Really good food, and more than adequate entertainment. My only complaint is other passengers: Just how much cabin luggage does one person need? Can't fit it in the locker above your seat? Then put it under the seat, not in the overhead space used by other passengers! Ideally, the airlines would enforce this for more comfortable travel, but they want to get their aircraft into the air on schedule.  Airfares are now cheaper than they have ever been, and people are still complaining.  One last request: Please try and consider the passenger in front of you. Banging and kicking your seat is very annoying.

F & B was fine, the FA's were great and always nice to hear a reassuring Australian voice at the controls. Two things. One was the flight being completely full. Really packed. Is it time for Qantas to have two London flights from Sydney or possibly to add a Perth flight? Last few times on QF1 & 2 there have been no empty seats. All well and good outsourcing some of the flights to Emirates but will always choose Qantas where possible. Second, Qantas should fit WiFi into the A380 service. EK has it and was good value. Being out of touch for 20 hours whilst flying is not really acceptable these days. These days getting on a Qantas long haul jet means it really does feel like home when stepping on.

The flight got off to a shaky start too, as boarding was delayed for more than half an hour with no explanation from gate staff other than two vague and non-reassuring references to a ""technical issue"". I was certain we'd be very late, however to Qantas' credit they made up time with the quickest boarding I've ever seen and we departed less than 5 minutes behind schedule. On board, the A330 was comfortable and modern and the IFE was amongst the best I've seen - certainly on par with Emirates in terms of quality, although perhaps not quite so much choice (but certainly more offerings to my taste). The 2-4-2 seating layout makes the A330 the ideal aircraft for travelling in a couple. Some crew were friendlier than others but overall I felt looked after. The meal choices were rather limited although the food was of a good quality. I would have preferred more frequent snacks. Service was excellent for the first part of the flight but all but disappeared around half way - disappointing as I would have preferred further drink and snack runs and was left hungry.

Passengers were never addressed by name and any request outside the usual was not dealt with. Breakfast was small and a second coffee was not offered. The Sky Bed is a generation behind the benchmark and storage is lacking.,0,5,J Gaffney,2016-10-04,no,Business Class,Business,LAX to MEL,September 2016,2,2,4,2,3,Qantas Airways
"""meal choices surprisingly limited""",Melbourne to Los Angeles with Qantas. I flew business class after previously flying Virgin Australia on the same route. The meal choices were surprisingly limited. The wine was reasonable for business but nothing outstanding. IFE movie choice was very poor with only 1 movie that looked current. The all male crew of FAs were good. The Sky Bed is showing it's age and is at least a generation behind the benchmark on other airlines.

"""expectations were exceeded""","London to Townsville via Perth & Brisbane with Qantas. When it comes to legacy airlines, especially those that have only just come back into black from near financial ruin, one doesn't expect much when travelling down the back in economy. In these circumstances it would be easy to say that my expectations were exceeded because I wasn't really expecting much. However, the overall quality of product and service goes far beyond this. I was booked on QF10 from LHR-DXB. It's a relatively short 7 hour flight and having travelled this route with both British Airways and Emirates I thought I knew what to expect. It was therefore a real pleasure to find a large, comfy pillow and lovely wide seat to relax in. The non-alcoholic welcome cocktail was a nice touch and there was a good selection of other drinks to choose from. I had been super intrigued to find out how the Qantas 'no tray' meal service works. In effect you do get one small tray on which sits the hot part of the meal. A pre-buttered hot roll is rested on top and the dessert comes in a separate disposable pot. It's an original and quirky idea which does work. However, I couldn't help but think that this deliberately allows Qantas to cut back on meal add ons like cheese and biscuits. Luckily the lamb curry and crumble dessert were of a decent size and tasty. The wine was of good quality and the post lunch hot drink offering was good. I wish I had gone for the hot chocolate and marshmallow option when I saw it was available but opted for the healthier peppermint tea. Throughout the rest of the flight the crew remained in the cabin offering water, juices and fresh fruit. The second snack meal was a tasty, heated pastry. One could help themselves to sweet granola bars from the galley during the flight. Cabin crew were professional and generally hospitable. The flight took off just a few minutes late despite a technical hitch in London and landed on time in Dubai. Luggage quickly arrived onto the carousel and I was out of the airport in next to no time. My second flight to Australia was with Emirates before rejoining Qantas in Perth to fly onto Brisbane and then a second flight up to Townsville. Check in at both PER and BNE was fully automated from seat selection to luggage tag printing and bag drop. Although this was efficient it did rather take away the human touch. The first flight to BNE was on an old 737 with little in the way of leg room and generally old, tired seats. Although there was no seatback IFE the plane was fitted with an audio/visual streaming service which was complimentary. There was a good choice of movies, TV shows and music. The second flight was just a short 2 hour hop. However, it was operated by a 737 with the new Boeing Sky interior, with seatback IFE. A dinner service was operated on this flight along with a chocolate Lindor to finish (a great touch). On both flights the crew were natural, warm and friendly. The new uniforms really stood out and showed off the crew in a good way. All in all a great experience with Qantas. I would highly recommend them after these flights.",0,8,C Brown,2016-10-01,yes,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,LHR to TSV via PER & BNE,September 2016,4,4,3,5,3,Qantas Airways
"""we were sadly disappointed""","Having flown from Venice to Dubai on Emirates where we experienced good food and good all round service we expected nothing less from Qantas on our journey to Melbourne. We were sadly disappointed. A 14hr flight and only one meal. A couple of small snacks and drinks but only one meal. By the time the meal service reached us there was no choice. There was only Thai fish curry left - not a meal that appealed to either my husband or myself. The senior cabin steward did go to the business class and found a couple of pot pies which were very nice. Qantas seems to have dispensed with some of the nicer service touches such as wet wipes on the meal tray or warm towels for refreshing yourself after a meal. Compared to Emirates the entertainment system is very limited in content. We had attempted to obtain a business class upgrade on our flights to Europe using freqent flyer points. Qantas staff had been less than helpful - asking for $800+ before processing our request, with no guarantee of the upgrade and no refund if we were not able to get it. Having traveled to Europe less than 2 years ago on Emirates I found that Qantas was inferior in all areas.",0,5,Judy Marsh,2016-09-30,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,DXB to MEL,September 2016,3,1,3,3,1,Qantas Airways

"""could not alter the seating""","Dubai to Wellington via Sydney. My elderly parents - my father is 88 years old with visual impairment and deaf, his wife is 75 with limited mobility due to arthritis and a recent hip replacement. They tried for an upgrade but this was unavailable. They next tried to pre select the seats but that was also unsuccessful. Instead they were given pre allocated seats that were 8 rows apart. There was no way we could alter this online so headed to the airport early. Sadly because this was a codeshare with Emirates (flying from Glasgow to Dubai with EK) we were told there add nothing we could do in Glasgow but I could phone Qantas ourselves. This we did and after a 20 minutes on the phone to a very helpful woman we were informed that the Qantas staff were in a break but when they were available she would sorry out the seating and get back to me. 45 minutes later and less than an hours before the parents had to go through security I called Qantas again. The person answering the phone could find no record of my previous call and more annoyingly could not alter the seating allocation for the parents but did say some one would get back to me in 48hours. So I left my elderly vulnerable parents at Glasgow worrying about how they will manage on the long leg of their journey with Qantas flying from Dubai to Sydney where they will not even have each other for support.

"""quality of service""","Tokyo to Brisbane. Qantas demonstrated poor quality of service straight from check in. Compulsory check in via kiosk and lack of check-in counters created a huge queue. Flights were also delayed once for 2 hours and another time for 40 minutes. Food and service is a step up from JetStar, which in turn offer no food and little service. Drinks are limited to whisky, wine and beer. Food is a junk food range. Attention for customers flying overseas! If you will have a problem you won't be able to contact Qantas customer service as Qantas has no 24/7 support and no phone number for contact from overseas. You will be dealing with local staff who is not employed by Qantas and cannot make any decisions, provide accommodation, food or even an advice. Movies are 20 years old.

Anyway, I used QFF points but wouldn't pay money for business class on such a short flight. Leather seat had crumbs and the footrest was extended and no matter how much I pressed the button and pushed it with my legs, it would not budge. Flight attendant managed to get it stowed away for landing. Water or juice offered. Called by my name, attentive service. Plenty of room compared to economy but definitely not A380 Business Class.

Having seen the quality and quantity of food take a steep nose dive and a reduction in service in Qantas economy class over the last few years, we were hopeful of a better experience in business class from Singapore to Sydney. Unfortunately we were disappointed. The flat bed is great, very comfortable. But with only two flight attendants the service was just basic, they had no time for niceties. The food was disgraceful for a flight departing at 2000 hrs local time. A 'supper plate' was a small plate of uninteresting and bland food, served with one slice of bread. Not even any salt and pepper. That was it, one small plate. We were both still hungry so asked for the cheese platter, which consisted of two small pieces of cheese, two dried apricots and two crackers. Breakfast was equally skimpy. Instead of making rubbish such as cookies, ice creams and chocolate available during the flight (not that we saw them), the airline should concentrate on giving passengers proper meals. We had just flown Air France business class from Paris to Singapore with double the number of flight attendants, warm, attentive service and superb food, so the low standards on Qantas were very noticeable.

She said no need in the beginning but later she added to take it with me just after luggages were being loaded to be weight and said ""if you are worried since it does not worry me"".

"""service was below what I expected""","Dubai to Melbourne. I found the quality and service was below what I expected from Qantas. The awkward design of seats leads to minimal storage and areas to place personal items and refreshment items. I found the sleeping position claustrophobic with my head stuck in a cocoon shell like arrangement. The handset control was buried in an awkward position and they warn you about it, and the hazards of not returning it correctly. The overhead reading light required you to stand and switch on at the bulkhead due to a faulty handset. The news section of the entertainment system did not operate. The flight attendant was unaware of my preordered meal. Responses to attendant calls took ages. The width of the seat/flatbed is less than other airlines. My foldout table was awkward to work (and if you are overweight forget it) it was broken and was told they would report it. The attendants must have all attended different days at the table laying lessons.

Unfortunately this is where the good service ended. Although this was an overnight flight, one would still expect a degree of service throughout the flight. The supper was small, took forever to serve and there was only one drink service offered. After supper it was near impossible to get the attention of a staff member. They seemed more interested in getting sleeping positions at the back of the plane. At times on Qantas the attendant's attitude can be tiresome and you felt after the meal service you were really putting them out by asking for a coffee or coke. Breakfast was actually ok considering that scrambled eggs can always be hit and miss on a plane. Once again there was a limited drink service and the last straw for me was when I asked for a water and it never came. Qantas is not a cheap airline and is trying to compete against Asian and Middle Eastern carriers. Good luck, you're going to need it!

"""service was superb""","What an excellent flight from Bangkok to Sydney with Qantas. I had a great seat that had a huge arm rest next to the aisle, so I was all cocooned. On board welcome was very warm and genuine and this set the mood for the rest of the flight. Amenity kit and duvet/pillow were already at the seat, as was a bottle of water. Pre-departure beverage was offered, and my champagne was topped up once more. Before take off, pyjama's were offered, and the mattress was attached to the seat. This would allow one to go to sleep quickly. Service was superb. I was addressed by several staff always by name (and they did not refer to the manifest). There was a drinks service with nuts. My glass was topped up 3 times, without having to ask, let alone think about it. Dinner service was over 2 hours into the flight, and food was excellent, but service even better. I had a great 6.5 hours sleep, having asked not to be woken for breakfast. When I did wake up, I was promptly asked what I wanted, and just settled for a coffee.

"""like flying no-frills""","Melbourne to Hong Kong in Economy with Qantas. It turns out Economy with Qantas is just slightly better than being put in the hold with the baggage. For an airline that charges hefty prices this was like flying no-frills, or maybe worse because their tickets are super expensive. The economy seats were the narrowest seats I have ever seen in a plane certainly for a 10 hour flight. The seats were much narrower than the seats on any of the other airlines that we took on our trip to Europe. It was extremely uncomfortable. Qantas seems to keep to the minimum number of staff possible. As a result, the service was as minimal as the seats. It took them ages to provide drinks and meals. The staff were nice enough but Economy passengers barely saw much of them. Given the high cost of our economy tickets, it was insulting to be treated like some sort of after thought. The worst food ever in so many different ways. Usually on an airline we get a tray of food containing a hot meal, a salad, perhaps some cheese and crackers, maybe another snack and a dessert. On Qantas they gave us a hot meal and a dessert. There was no tray and there was no other food. Just a small sized hot meal and a dessert. That was it. As it happened the hot meal was just awful so we only had the dessert. Even the kids received a hot meal and an apple. In contrast, when our kids flew with Cathay they received a tray of food including a hot meal, juice, fruit, cupcake, snack, cheese. Our kids didn't like the hot meal and when we asked if they had something else, after ages waiting, a staff member brought some dry biscuits and another apple. There were a lot of apples on this Qantas flight but much not of anything else. We got off our Qantas flight absolutely starving hungry. I don't mind flying no-frills but if Qantas wants to provide a no frills flight on Economy then the price should be no frills as well. Except it isn't. Qantas is usually more expensive than other airlines flying to and from Australia.

"""left to our own devices""",All airlines experience problems from time to time. Ours was a delay in departure due to 'technical' problems. Ok - I accept this happens. However - customer relations becomes vital at this time. Information about transfers - new arrival times so you can re-book accommodation car hire etc.. it all becomes important. None of this happened. We were basically left to our own devices with a £10 voucher at Heathrow and then a cheap hotel in Dubai whilst awaiting a re-booked flight via Sydney - which we had no choice in or discussion about. When boarding the re-routed flight we were treated as if it was our fault - sat separately and I wont bore you with the details about the service. On our return I wrote to Qantas and simply asked for acknowledgement of my letter addressing my concerns. This was not forthcoming. Eventually - 4 months latter I get a very limp email. Poor. So - I have since found an interesting piece of EU legislation C(2016) 3502. Basically any flight leaving from an EU airport is covered by this. I advise any Qantas passenger to be aware of their rights for compensation.

"""no longer a premium airline""","Qantas has deteriorated significantly in recent times, it is no longer a premium airline. Qantas now has an ageing fleet, fewer crafts, and serious staffing issues. This essentially means more cancellations, technical issues, delays, and a deteriorating service. We booked our tickets to Rome with Qantas as the flights selected had a convenient midday departure with a two-hour stopover in Sydney, and three hours in Dubai. However, problems started before we left home. 1) Qantas cancelled our first flight and rescheduled a departure time three hours earlier. The new 9.00am departure created a five-hour first stopover in Sydney 2) Qantas then delayed the Sydney departure due to 'engineering requirements' by four hours. They kept extending the delay every 30 minutes, making it impossible to modify onward journey arrangements. The stopover had extended to nine hours from two. 3) This resulted in missing our connecting flight in Dubai. We were rebooked into a flight scheduled to depart more than five hours later. 4) My wife and I were assigned separated seats, as the flight was full. Further to this, the Qantas flight service was extremely tardy. They kept forgetting to bring my wife’s meal, which she received two hours after others had finished eating. The cabin was a constant mess as the cabin staff was extremely slow in removing trays, etc. 5) We arrived eight hours late in Rome and missed our connecting Alitalia flight. The result, Alitalia forfeited our return tickets that cost $1540 to replace.

The bottom line is that 31 inches in international economy is simply not competitive for a full service carrier.

It would have been easy for me (US Passport) to get one electronically in Denpasar, but my wife has a Cambodian passport, so it would have required us missing our flight and getting one the next day at the Australian embassy.

"""professional and attentive""",Our overnight flight from Tokyo Haneda to Sydney on QF26 lived up to the expectation of Qantas business class. We were seated in seats 3A and 3B in a roomy section of the cabin. Service was professional and attentive without being overly invasive. The cabin was prepared for the night flight and supper was served promptly after this. Food was excellent. A selection of Japanese food was offered and was very tasty. Seat is comfortable with plenty of room. Onboard entertainment worked well although I do not watch much of this.

"""impressive dinner service""",Impressive dinner service in economy. Flew short trip Adelaide to Melbourne in the evening. The cabin crew were more mature then a lot of other airlines and while they did not look like supermodels they exuded experienced and confidence that made an impact. They must enjoy their job otherwise why were they doing it for so long. The experience made a big difference compared to the younger crew we often get on airlines. I was expecting a bag of peanuts on such a short hop (as we had on another airline coming over) but instead they rolled out dinner. The Qantas bigger economy meals were noticeably large and I was hungry and as I was not getting home until 10.30pm I was very happy to actually have a satisfying meal - plus red wine and just when i was wishing for something sweet along came a chocolate. The Flight attendant later came and gave me a handful of extra chocolates as a sudden surprise gift. They are a little more expensive than a budget airline but there is a big difference and I would pay an extra few dollars for this kind of service. They are obviously trying hard to give a great service and I was surprised and impressed.,0,9,K Davids,2016-05-11,yes,Economy Class,Business,ADL to MEL,May 2016,4,4,4,5,5,Qantas Airways

Onwards from Dubai on Emirates to London. Same aircraft but a different look naturally and feel. It was a 3.45 pm departure from Dubai and the clientele on this leg were very different. A large element of holiday makers. Nothing wrong with that but a fair few were continuously ordering drinks. Good natured bunch but one can understand why LCC have a problem when they continue to serve. I really want to love EK but the inconsistent nature of the FA's makes it hard.

Nothing to report save the usual level of service and courtesy that one expects. I may be biased towards Qantas being a gold FF but they have upped thier game. One gripe and it's nothing that can be done on this flight. It lands at around 5 am. So breakfast is served around 3.15am local time. Personally speaking the thought of eggs and sausage do not appeal but breakfast has to be served so there it is. Coffee and fruit was enough for me. Suggestions to Qantas? How about a daytime flight back to Sydney like the old QF 32. That way one can enjoy it.

"""overuse of the word mate ""","Travelled with my husband and three children from Oslo to Melbourne on Emirates tickets, with the Dubai to Melbourne leg operated by Qantas. Stark contrast in quality of service, food and cabin fitout between Emirates and Qantas. Qantas staff seemed preoccupied with getting passengers to sleep as quickly as possible above all else, including requests for a bottle to get my tollder settled (grumpy, exhausted 3 year olds aren't conducive to getting a cabin full of people to sleep!). Kids weren't allowed to change seats before take off despite ample unoccupied seats after boarding was complete. Staff did however allow an adult male to change to an empty row of 4 seats before take off. On previous Emirates flights the kids seemed to be given at least a fair chance of occupying spare seats therefore increasing the possibility that they would sleep (which benefits the entire cabin). Kids meal on Qantas was a bread-like tube filled with veges and tomato sauce and a packet of Smarties. Contrast this with Emirates: hot bowl of macaroni cheese, rolls, a dessert, a drink, and a box full of snacks like small chocolate bars, crackers, crisps, and a small toothbrush kit. Entertainment system on Qantas was measly compared to Emirates with very few family movies and a smaller screen. Noticeably less leg room (my husband is 6 foot 4). In terms of service quality - only one staff member in our section seemed happy to be on the flight and conversed with our kids beyond 'Hi mate'. Qantas should be aware that (over)use of the word 'mate' doesn't make up for a lack of genuine care in making a kid's 13 hours in a confined space surrounded by snoring adults as comfortable as possible. On Emirates I felt totally comfortable asking for extra drinks, crisps etc for the kids (to reduce their loud 'I'm hungry' complaints). On Qantas I soon realised that these requests were treated as big extra workloads by the staff. On the plus side, my husband enjoyed the snack bar at the back of the plane.",0,4,M Novaja,2016-04-27,no,Economy Class,Family Leisure,DXB to MEL,April 2016,2,2,2,2,2,Qantas Airways

I understand it isn't their problem if something breaks is there a need to be nasty. The food was horrible, they ran out of the choices and was told I could either have curry or nothing. The seats were so uncomfortable with no leg room. I am 5""11 and was cramped the entire time! Not impressed with the flight and service at all.

The lounge did not offer any hot western breakfast, but some light snacks and toast. I was onboard a reconfigured Boeing 737 to Melbourne. Qantas removed personal TVs but they added WiFi onboard. However, the WiFi can only be used for the Qantas entertainment app for movies and flight status. Moreover, it worker slow. It was not a big deal as the flight was just 50 minute. Breakfast was yoghurt. At Melbourne, I headed to T2 for QF29 to Hong Kong. I did not manage to enter the lounge as I was running out of time! The queue at gate 11 in T2 was disaster. Passengers were required to take to escalator down for boarding and boarding pass scanning. Business class and Oneworld Emerald / Sapphire passengers were offered priority queue there! Onboard, a fresh new cabin, seats were comfy, all seats have a footrest and a shelf under the TV (except for front rows). The screen was responsive. Fortunately, the flight was only 70% full and no one sat next to me. There were four options for lunch with one only eligible for pre-booking online. I chose that, chicken with roast potato and vegetables which delicious.  Prior landing, hot dog was offered and it was good. Overall, the journey was smooth and comfortable. However, the WiFi should have access to the internet and Qantas must improve the queue at gate 11 in Melbourne. The journey (return flights) cost AUD700 / HKD3780. Very reasonable and attractive.

Some were extra charming and professional but others were extremely rude. Flight departed 30 minutes late. Had issues with IFE that took nearly an hour to fix. Food on Qantas was pathetic and stingy. So called supper served on a 8pm flight assuming passengers do not need to be fed. Dessert had a cheese plate which actually had one piece of cheese. During dinner service one of the male crew was so rude to a kid that his father had to speak to the purser. It was disappointing to witness this. Seats on the newly refurbished A330-300 are comfy and fantastic for a good night rest. Short flight time meant arrived in Sydney before time.

I sent another email requesting a response. 12 April 2016 I posted on their facebook. 14 April 2016 I received a response stating their disclaimers etc. In conclusion, they feel that they are justified not compensating anything as little as a voucher or miles.

The cabin is old and tired, and the IFE unresponsive at the best of times, with a tiny selection of movie, and appalling resolution. It ought to have been banished to the last decade.

I was looked after very well. I should point out that when booking on the Qantas page, there is no way of telling whether the A330 is refurbished or not - yet, the prices are the same. When there is such a massive difference in quality between the old and refurbished cabin, it is indeed very disappointing to leave this crucial piece of information.

"""felt discriminated against""","As Americans now living in Australia who also travel for work, we use air travel a great deal. My wife has maintained Platinum status with Qantas. I choose another airline, and after this latest Qantas experience, she is switching. We both wrote letters to Qantas about the terrible experience, the poor service of crew in business class, yet they were unconcerned. Despite using 170,000 points to upgrade, their only offer, after repeated hounding them that they needed to do something to right the wrong, they were only willing to offer 10,000 points back! The experience? On the long flight from Los Angeles to Brisbane in Business Class, we were amazed to find a family with young children seated in the rows next to and behind us. The family proceeded to conduct themselves as though they were the only people aboard the plane, making an incessant racket the entire 15 or so hours, always needing flight crew to deal with their non-stop issues. Never once did crew ask them to respect the other passengers who were trying to sleep through the night, nor did they apologise to any passengers for the constant disruptions and noise, even after it was pointed out. When we realised we would not be getting any sleep to prepare for work as soon as we landed, we tried inflight entertainment. It didn't work. Took over an hour, and even then was a dodgy work-around where you could join a handful of programs already in progress. We felt discriminated against and find their unwillingness to make an effort to keep a loyal customer who has spent a small fortune with their airline absolutely appalling.

Not much engagement with the passengers. Small main meal then a cheese cracker service then a kit kat chocolate service (they seem to have split up the usual meal tray items and served them separately to give the impression you are getting 'a lot' to eat I suppose).

Even on domestic flights on the A330 was better and more modern. The cabin had an old musky odour and the seats lost the firmness and worn out. Video screen tiny and with scratches on them poor images and sound quality. Service from the crew was plastic at best. Spent more time chatting and laughing in the galleys and when you go there to ask for water you get an annoyed look from them. Flight was barely full and yet they ran out of meal choices and bottled water so those at back of plane would get nothing. Qantas has cut corners on the meals with small servings.

The overhead bin had more than enough space for my luggage and backpack, and the area, to the side of the seat had so much storage, with two drawers, as well as ample room, on top. The service during the flight was amazing, and the food was delicious. I felt like the crew could not do enough - rare feeling, while flying. The bed is very comfortable - a Flight Attendant placed the sheepskin mattress cover, sheets, duvet and pillows, and I slept so well. When I awoke, it was noticed (again, rare), and asked if I would like anything to eat or drink. The in-flight entertainment seemed, endless-movies, television, CD's, and more.

I find it patronising to automatically assumed to be a problem drinker.The flight was late pushing back and we were assured many times that we would arrive into Bangkok early. We landed late into Bangkok because of congestion. There was one announcement that those of us with connections should be at the gate at least 1 hour before our departing flight and apart from that we were on our own.  The plane was an elderly A330.

Premium Check in at PER with short lines and fairly fast. However I noticed that Y check-in was full self-service including tagging and dropping off luggage and I didn’t really see any QF staff to offer any assistance at the kiosks. Used the QF domestic lounge, which was spacious and comfortable; various cold food choices and fresh pizza. Alcohol and espressos served at a manned bar with nice drink choices. Boarding was uneventful. On board actual business class seats were comfortable and much better than what European airlines offer on short European flights. FA’s professional and attentive but not particularly friendly. Choice of 2 starters, 5 mains and 3 desserts were offered and I found the Chinese style steamed white fish to be quite good. Australian wines very nice with regular top ups. In-seat on-demand IFE offered with a limited but good enough choices of movies. Impressive product for a domestic flight. As for value for money, I am not so sure. I burned some miles for this flight, so value was actually good. However I also checked the prices for QF on this route and the prices that came up for both C and Y were substantially higher than what I would consider an acceptable price for a four hour flight for both classes, even if considering the good experience QF offered on this flight.",0,9,R Simon,2016-02-19,yes,Business Class,Solo Leisure,PER to SYD,January 2016,5,5,5,4,3,Qantas Airways

The so called sky bed is narrow which doesn't allow for sleeping on ones side, rather only on the back with an uncomfortable set up with arms across the stomach.

The first two legs of the trip were First Class as we had booked a first Class round world ticket. The plane on the leg from Sydney to Auckland had no first Class so we had Business boarding passes. The lounge got very funny with us. This should not have been the case. Once we arrived in Auckland our Luggage which had been checked right through was not there. We spent ages waiting then reporting and recording the fact it had not arrived. There was no apology and although we were First Class passengers we were not kept advised of when it may arrive.

"""ground services be improved""","As much as I appreciate Qantas inflight service, I believe that their operations / ground services can be improved. Flying to AKL from HKG in business, I won the bid for upgrade from economy. When arrived at the check it I was informed my flight was delayed 12 hours! I didn't receive any notification before (like most airlines do) that would have avoided me to go all the way to the check in. In that moment I have been told that they did not know when I was gonna get my connection to AKL. Went back home, they after I learnt that I would have needed to spend one night in Sydney as there was no connecting flight the same day. That meant that I would arrive 20 hours after the planned time, losing one full day of travel. And I could not check in until AKL directly, meaning that I would need to take my luggage in Sydney, and check in again the morning after (with a 5 hours sleep maximum). In Sydney the hotel provided was very convenient (right in the airport) but no breakfast was provided. I wrote to Qantas to complain about these issues, but after 10 days I did not hear back anything from them.

"""seats reclined too far""","Sydney to Singapore return with Qantas. SYD-SIN on a newly-refurbished A330, returning on one of the old A330s. The old A330 was the same as the one I've regularly taken from Sydney to Shanghai. It's OK, but the seat-back TV screen is extremely small. That's the only problem on that plane. It was an overnight flight, and service was OK. The other problem with the flight was that Qantas ground staff in Sydney were not prepared for our arrival. We had to park in the cargo area, and wait for a stairway truck to come to us. After about 15-20 minutes, a stairway truck arrived, but without the member of staff needed to open the door. So we had to wait another 20 minutes while they found someone who knew how to open the door. It appears that the daily arrival of QF6 still comes as a surprise to Qantas' Sydney ground staff. The newly-refurbished A330 had better-padded seats and much, much bigger TV screens. It was a daytime flight, and service was OK. However, on the newly-refurbished A330, the seats reclined too far. There was a good 3-4 inches more recline than I've seen in economy on any other plane. The person in front of me decided to recline as soon as the seat-belt light was switched off. This spilled the drink on my table, and left me with the back of her seat less than five inches from my nose.  Viewing the big, new TV screen was now impossible. Accessing the seat pockets was impossible. Eating and drinking was impossible, and even moving was difficult. The woman next to me had the same problem with the person in front of her. We both had to move: it was impossible to stay in those seats for a daytime flight. Even getting out of our seats to move elsewhere was extremely difficult. Very few people had chosen to use the full recline, so this wasn't a problem for most of the other passengers, although this was pure luck. Fortunately, we did manage to find alternative seats. However, having paid an extra A$30 to select my seat (a window seat near the front), I wasn't thrilled to end up in a centre-aisle seat in the very back row. Other than this, the flight was OK. But Qantas really needs to look at a way of restricting recline to normal levels. If this can't be resolved, I'll be avoiding Qantas flights on refurbished A330s: the seats are completely unusable if the person in front uses the full recline.",0,5,B McLaughlin,2016-02-01,no,Economy Class,Business,SYD to SIN,January 2016,1,2,3,2,3,Qantas Airways
"""flight attendants were a mixed bag""","Mediocre service from start to finish and quite disappointing with Qantas Airways. Check in at Sydney for the Los Angeles and New York JFK sectors very quick and efficient. First leg, QF11 to LAX, departed a full hour late, due to late boarding, with no announcement. Boarding was chaotic and not streamlined by cabin and deck level. A380 interior looks tired. Sat on the upper deck bulk head just behind Premium Economy. Flight attendants were a mixed bag. Some were very nice, others would not make eye contact, and were just a slight cut above what you would find on a US domestic flight. Toilets kept clean and tidy throughout the flight and the entertainment system was good. Catering not bad for Economy and plenty of snack options for the 14 hour journey. One flight attendant got us snacks from Business Class at one point. Transit at LAX to the JFK flight (on the BNE-LAX aircraft) is a mess. Long lines and poor signage. Never clear where you are to leave your luggage and you have to go back through security even though you are staying within the TBIT. No wonder the QF11 LAX-JFK flight is always late. Our flight departed a full 90 minutes behind schedule and arrived an hour late. The plane, a 747-400, was ancient and falling apart inside and out. Worn out seats, broken IFE, filthy lavatories, and dirty seat cushions. Cabin crew only interested in chit chatting with their friends and family and moving some to business class as a courtesy. Only plus of this flight is not having to change terminals. Long wait for baggage at JFK. Overall, a mediocre experience with an airline that I had high hopes for, but featured a tired product.

The toilets were very clean and the whole aircraft looked new even though it was 6 years old. Upon cruising we had a meal. I opted for the meat option. The unique feature about the aircraft was the Sky-cam. This is a camera mounted on the tail of the aircraft. If you walk to the back of the aircraft, there was a selection of cans, cartons, cakes and fruit you could have. Upon landing at Dubai there was a crew change. One of the best flights I have been on.

Up at 4am to wait for an hour only to be told our flight was cancelled and to see the Qantas sales staff. Well you'd swear they were volunteers, one hour to process each person, fortunately we were next in line but waited the full hour. They got us on a direct flight but economy Qantas that afternoon at 3pm. I had a broken wrist (3 weeks prior) and said they put us in a window seat (wrong side - wrist-wise) for my husband and aisle for me in different rows. Turned out I had a middle seat and had to twist my body for all the flight to stop any contact with my wrist. Anyway they said at the sales desk that we could check in our bags at 9.30am. We waited and did that only to be told that our bags could be lost by checking them in so early. We took the risk as I couldn't help my husband with the bags at all. The plane itself was dirty, the above air vents/lights were caked in dust/dirt/grime - not cleaned in a very long time. There were plenty of shows to watch but the screen was very slow to respond, but it did work. The meal in a box was edible (just) but bland (cold chicken slices on cold pasta). The FA's were nice though, they came through with offers of refreshments and were quite cheery. Our bags did make it in the end but it was a nervous wait.

Seat was reasonably spacious being a window seat however the aisle passenger next to me hogged the armrest and protruded themselves about 4 inches into my 'airspace' fairly often. Check-in was quite efficient. Departure gate was central to the main food court and shops. Was a little disappointed with the fabric upholstered seats which already showed signs of fraying together with torn pockets and the responsiveness of the touch screen.

My wife and I were literally imprisoned by the gate representative and the airlines ""medical representative."" My wife is in a wheelchair so we require special assistance to board. When we arrived at the airport, both of us were sick from catching bad colds in Tasmania on a rainy day from a cruise excursion. We had coughed and sneezed quite a bit and smelled of cough medicine. They dragged us off to a private lounge and insisted that my wife take a shower. The place was like a sauna and her cold got even worse, as did mine. They insisted that she put on some ""mickey mouse"" outfit that was so tight that it was described as a major scrape to her body by nurses who later examined her. When we returned to the gate they informed us that they had changed our seats to all the way in the back, which would make it very difficult for us to board and disembark since she really can't walk. It took forever for us to do both, which prolonged my wife's misery. Due to the shower, she coughed the entire flight back to Los Angeles. The medical staff woman ensured us that the seat change was for our benefit since I would be closer to the bathroom at the back of the plane. Hopefully she will be re-assigned to sweeping the floors. The flight itself was highlighted by the refusal of the Captain to turn on the seat belt sign in midflight until the plane was practically being violently tossed. The flight crew also needs a refresher course in disbursing and retrieving food. It was very disorderly. I had to tell the flight attendant 3 times that I didn't want to eat Barramundi, which as she explained was a fish, in case I didn't know.

I proceeded to the Qantas luggage counter (which was empty) and they directed me to the General luggage counter (which had a very long queue). After about half an hour, the ground staff said our luggage was left in Melbourne and it would be forwarded on the next Qantas flight in 2 hours. The luggage could be sent to us if we provided a hotel name and address. Unfortunately, we were on a camper van holiday! So we waited at the airport for 3 hours, but the bags were not sent on the next Qantas flight. We were told to wait another 3 hours. We highlighted that our camper van shop was about to close. We were then given a telephone number to call. After collecting our camper van we called and the ground staff told us the bags would arrive at 9pm. At 9pm, they told us the bags did not arrive and it would be sent the next morning. Finally, at 2pm the next day, the bags were sent by Emirates. We went back to the airport to collect our bag, the ground staff handed us our bag, my friend signed on a form and that was it. We were not given a copy. No one from Qantas or Emirates apologized! When I returned to Singapore, I e-mailed Qantas. Qantas responded that I had flew Emirates and I should claim from Emirates! I wrote to Emirates and Emirates called back, the call basically went, ""I am calling from Emirates, I am so sorry to hear about your baggage delay.

"""worst travelling experience""",Melbourne to New York via Los Angeles in Qantas Business class.  This would have to rate as one of the worst travelling experiences we have had. It began at check-in to find our seat had been changed and while travelling as a couple we had been split up. When we pointed this out we were seated together but with bad grace. This was followed by disorganisation at the boarding gate in Melbourne where everyone was herded together with no attempt to have controlled lines. Having boarded we were advised of a delay with the reason given as refuelling being late. An attempt at humour was offered that perhaps the re-fuelers had overindulged at Christmas. Total inefficiency would have been a more accurate explanation. We arrived in LA late so transfer to New York flight was chaotic and delayed. Qantas staff at LAX gave the impression they had no idea as to how to handle the situation. To top this experience our luggage was lost and two days later has not been located. We were directed to British Airways luggage service at JFK and they have been hopeless. Luggage was not forwarded as promised that night and next morning as we were departing for Canada we went to the office again and they could not tell us where it was.

This service from Qantas is disgraceful. An email sent to Qantas customer feedback resulted in an automated response indicated a 15 day wait. The seat in business class is fine but would be very hard without the addition of a quilt like mattress provided. The food certainly does not live up to the hype of a Neil Perry menu.

"""frankly disappointing""","A mediocre flight, and frankly disappointing. Living in Sydney, I fly Qantas regularly. On this occasion the crew was a let-down. The Qantas lounge in Hong Kong was superb - great ambience and had waiter-served 3-course Christmas menu. It was particularly appreciated, since I have a view of the chaos that was the boarding process at the gate downstairs. The boarding could be described, generously, as absolute shambles - disorderly and disorganised. It took at least 40 minutes for most passengers to board and 20 minutes after the gates supposed to be closed. On the flight, the service was incredibly slow, and the presence of the crew was sparse. I was seated at upper deck economy cabin, which was supposed to be quiet with ample attention from the cabin crew given the few seats. The opposite was the case on this flight. The economy cabin shares the galley with the Premium Economy cabin that is immediately in front. All trolley traffic, therefore, must first go past the economy. This proved to be very bothersome. The upper economy cabin is served by one trolley only; meal and drinks is served on one aisle, then the second aisle. If you have the misfortune of sitting on the left rear part of the cabin, too bad, you will have to wait a long time for your food even though there are only about 30 passengers in it! By the time the fellow at the left end of my row received his meal I had almost finished mine. To make matters worse, the crew was not particularly professional. It was made quite obvious to me and the rest of the passengers that the crew knew two of the passengers. One was possibly former cabin crew, and the other, possibly a very frequent flyer, whose name most of the cabin crew knew. These two passengers received extra drinks from the Premium Economy trolley, blankets and attention during the flight. These were all little gestures, and fair enough that airlines should show gratitude for loyalty. Yet, I daresay most passengers who managed to secure an upper deck seat are frequent flyers of some manner (the lady next to me was Qantas Platinum, and I had seen a few of the faces in the Qantas lounge). To have low presence and under-service the cabin while blatantly giving special treatment to passengers they knew was quite unprofessional - we also paid similar amounts for the same seats! To add insult to injury, while I was lining up at the Duty-Free at Sydney Airport I got shoulder-charged by one of the cabin crew as she left the counter, still in her uniform. No apology given.

The first disappointment was that Qantas used an A330 with the old style business class seats which was a questionable decision since you would think for passenger comfort on an overnight 6 hour flight they would use the newer style lie flat seats. The old style seats were just bigger and had more recline. Qantas really needs to improve on the standard of the their food especially in business. I had a crumbed snapper fillet which was barely better than the supermarket crumbed fish. The salads on the side were almost inedible. The breakfast service was canceled before the captain kept on saying more turbulence is expected, although there were only a few minutes of moderate to heavy turbulence. although I guess this isn't the pilot's fault as safety was still the first priority. Overall I would recommend that it was not worth paying for business class in cash, but if it's a point upgrades I may still be worth it for you.",0,5,Michael Qian,2015-12-17,no,Business Class,Solo Leisure,Perth to Auckland,December 2015,3,1,4,4,3,Qantas Airways
"""has picked up its game""","I am a longtime flyer of Qantas and have to say that Qantas has picked up its game on the Domestic side of things. Boarding our flight out of Perth, we were greeting by enthusiastic, accommodating staff. The meal service was prompt and the salad was better than one I could prepare myself. It's also pleasing to have lighter options on offer instead of the usual stodge. During the meal service, my husband and I overheard an exchange between a dissatisfied customer and staff - all handled promptly and with professionalism in our opinion. The flight to Tokyo was a little bit different. Having high expectations after excellent domestic service, I was dismayed to see a dated aircraft that unfortunately was not properly cleaned from the flight before. The crew were more subdued and lacking enthusiasm and it was back to the usual stodge for the meals. Unfortunately as well, I am a bit of a nervous flyer, and I find the announcements from the pilot helpful when there is going to be turbulence. After four hours of bouncing around, the pilot finally addressed the cabin. While I know they are busy and focused, a little reassurance makes a lot of difference and looking around - I know I am not the only one.

Cabin crew seem much more polite and attentive than a decade ago. However, much needs to be done to improve the quality of service.

Handed our menus for late supper took off on time. The flight was uneventful as one would hope, however when our supper arrived it was sent back - something like a cold hamburger was served and there was really nothing else on the menu that I preferred so I settled for a salad and roll. I must admit the crew were apologetic but that's about all - my expectations about Qantas started to dive. We were served breakfast which was much better. The Dubai to London leg started to restore my faith in Qantas only to be let down (not by the crew who were first class) but by a Neil Perry cardboard box served meal, I don't know of any airline that serves business class passengers a cardboard box.

Unlike the Qantas staff, the Emirates team were well aware that the flight wasn't going anywhere. Back in the lounge, the departure time kept getting put back in hourly increments. To add insult to injury, not even a glass of champagne on boarding the J Class cabin. Finally Dubai, where despite the disaster of connecting flights, only one security screening land for 200 people.

"""premium product is rubbish""","Qantas A380 must be one of the only mainstream carriers to not have horizontal lay flat beds these days. The seats on the Qantas A380 seats have not been upgraded since introduction in 2008. I had the misfortune to be routed on a Qantas A380 via a Finnair ticket. As reward for ""being one of Qantas ""most valued customers"" I had the misfortune of sitting next to a mother and irritable infant. Initially the CSM advised that he would move me to an alternative seat for which I was understandably grateful, only to be informed later that ""I was not going to be happy"" when he told me the passenger he thought was on a staff ticket was also a Qantas Platinum  PAX. An understatement. Just what any business traveller needs after paying for a premium ticket. It would appear that the Qantas system is so unintelligent that it is unable to recognise when its ""most valuable customers"" are seated next to mothers and infants. The premium product is rubbish in so many regards. Most Asian carriers Particularly CX and SQ are in a completely different league to QF - sad but true. Forgot to mention also that the flight was late and as a consequence, I only just made a connection to NZ. ""Use our 1st class lounge and enjoy an relaxing shower in Sydney"" is Qantas code for race through the SYD terminal when our flights are late and you've had no sleep on premium ticket from Europe and arrive at the gate with a heart rate of 180 feeling clammy and hungry!",0,1,W Franklin,2015-12-14,no,Business Class,Business,Hong Kong to Sydney,December 2015,1,2,2,2,1,Qantas Airways
"""nothing could be done""","Most recent experience on Qantas Airways, QF15, Brisbane to LAX, Business Class on 2 Dec 2015. I made reservations for 2 business class tickets some 11 months ago and selected seats 3D and3E on what was sold to me as their new ""A380 business class product"" on a brand new configured 747-400. 3 days before departure I went online and found that we had been reseated in aisle seats in 2 different rows. I called Qantas and was told that we were reallocated with no plausible explanation. I was told that this would be their new A380 product. When we got to the airport and checked in I asked the check-in agent about the aircraft, she told me the flight was being operated by an old 747 that was not refurbished. We proceeded thru customs and security and went to the Qantas Lounge to find that it was completely packed with not one single seat available for use. We were told 3 separate times that our flight was boarding, the original time of boarding at 10.15 came and went then we were told 10.45 and then 11.00, the actual time was after 11.30. Onboard the seat controls worked sporadically, the stained and worn seat had little if any padding, when I brought this to the attention of the flight crew they offered to put on a pad (they call it a mattress) on it. This did little to alleviate this discomfort. The meal was a pork chop consisting of a piece of meat that could not be cut and wen I asked for a salad they told me they had run out. The breakfast offered some 10 hours later was even worse with stale breads and hard. The crew told me that the IVOD system was broken and that nothing could be done. After I sent the breakfast tray away I asked if I could simply have a cup of tea with milk, some 20 minutes later they brought the same coffee I had already sent back.",0,1,John O'Regan,2015-12-11,no,Business Class,Business,Brisbane to LAX,December 2015,1,1,1,1,1,Qantas Airways
"""recommend Business Class""","I booked Economy Brisbane to Sydney and then Premium Economy from Sydney to Hong Kong on 10 December to try Premium Economy and fly the A380 for the first time but I had also registered for an upgrade to Business (at the cost of 25,000 QFF points) and I was granted this.  You made a 20-year QFF veteran very happy. I don't think I will ever be able to go back to Economy for a long haul flight ever again. So much space, I didn't know what to do with it! Being called by my name by pleasant flight attendants, a table cloth, nice tasty food, non-stop drinks, proper head phones, amenities kit with socks and toiletries, back massaging options, the list goes on. The A380 is a beautiful aircraft, really quiet and there was hardly any turbulence. I thought the selection of movies was disappointing - there was a lot to select from, but I had either seen them or wasn't interested in the rest. I should have also caught an earlier Brisbane to Sydney flight (minimum 2 hours not 1 hour 25 minutes). I walked straight onto the connecting bus to the International terminal and it was quick getting through immigration but security was very congested with long lines, so there was no time for any duty free shopping or dawdling to the gate (also don't forget about daylight saving if you are from Queensland). I had to walk quickly and boarding was already occurring when I got to the gate but the Business Class line for the upper level of the aircraft had hardly anyone in it. Once on board, there was a delay in pushing back and the Captain kept everyone informed of what was exactly was going on (this is welcomed instead of being vague). Being one of the first off the plane in Hong Kong was great, but there was a lengthy wait for my bag (probably not the fault of Qantas), where you start to fear that your bag never made the flight, but it eventually appeared on the baggage carousel.

What is noticeable is the soft skills in Qantas compared to EK. Meals are also a common criticism made of Qantas. Frankly I do not want a full meal at 2.25am when QF1 leaves DXB for LHR. A snack will suffice. This last trip which involved QF 1&2 over a 5 day trip was pretty much spot on with where Qantas is now. Massively improved from a few years ago. Cabin service was friendly and helpful. To those who keep grumbling about FA's, well smile at them and say please and thank you. Much to complain about on this last trip? Not really. In the economy cabin from London to Dubai on QF 2. The pax nearby was moaning about breakfast being a date muffin.

A great selection of movies and TV options as well, once again, as great service made this flight not seem so long.

"""the service was perfunctory""",We travelled from Sydney to New York and return in business with Qantas. On all legs one could only say the service was perfunctory. The cabin staff were either almost mute or in the case of one individual excessively talkative. There is no charm or sense of energy in what seems to be a deliberate attempt to make the staff as colourless as possible. At the beginning of the flight the flight service director comes to each passenger to introduce themselves and to engage in robotic conversation. I am generally a good sleeper however I found the beds to be uncomfortable despite the overlay which made the 14 hour legs a lengthy experience. One positive was the food and beverages where the selection was attractive and the quality high. In our view Qantas is not in the same league as its Asian and Middle Eastern competitors and the lack of profitability of its international services is easily explained by the quality of its not inexpensive product.,0,5,Ross Butler,2015-12-06,no,Business Class,Couple Leisure,New York to Sydney,November 2015,2,4,4,2,2,Qantas Airways

"""left feeling disappointed""","I flew Qantas from Melbourne to London via Dubai return. Having not flown Business on a Qantas long-haul flight for some time, I have been left feeling disappointed. Of all the things that stick out in my mind, it is the poor service of the Business class crew. Maybe my expectations were off but at no point was I made to feel special. Examples include only 75% of the cabin being offered the bed turn-down service - I'm not sure why I and a few others were excluded from this. Being handed a bottle of water while the crew was looking and talking to someone else (I found this particularly rude). It was just about shoved in my face. Not having my meal order being taken while the person directly beside me did, and then being told by the crew ""oh your order isn't on the list I assumed you weren't eating, let me see what I can do"" as if she was doing me a favour! These are all small insignificant things, but when you drop $7K+ on a flight you expect better. The seat is comfortable enough, although I note Qantas has a 2-2-2 config versus Emirates 1-2-1. The interior of drab cabin colours aren't particularly appealing either for a 22 hours of flying. No WiFI (which I can live without, yet other airlines have it). Inflight entertainment was satisfactory, but Qantas policy doesn't allow you to bring out the screen until you are in the air. Based on my experience I will certainly not be choosing Qantas again for long haul flights. If you can get an Emirates flight for the same or similar price then you'd be mad not to go with Emirates.",0,6,A Louey,2015-11-12,no,Business Class,Solo Leisure,MEL to LHR via DXB,November 2015,4,3,4,2,3,Qantas Airways

The entertainment system is fine. The biggest issue with this flight for me is the food, or the lack of it. As has been mentioned before, it's 1.5-2 hours into the flight before supper is served. That's too long. To add to this, breakfast is not served until 11-12 am Melbourne time the next day. I went to the galley to ask for a snack and while I got what I was after (a tub of yoghurt) the staff looked at me like it was a strange request.

"""flight was uneventful""","The first leg of the journey was great, as the JFK-LAX flight was only half full and I got to switch to an empty middle row to sleep for a bit. The cabin crew were very relaxed and friendly - most likely due to the lack of passengers. I don't remember if a meal was served, but most likely a snack was given. The second leg, LAX-SYD, wasn't quite as great - the plane was really full, the cabin crew weren't as friendly or approachable. Usually when I step onto a Qantas flight, I already feel like I'm back home in Aus but it wasn't the case here. I had also asked about an upgrade to premium economy at the desk for this part of the journey but was told it'd cost me around 4 or 5 thousand dollars, even though that's almost the same price as a return prem-econ flight from SYD-LHR. I wasn't happy to be tersely turned away, considering I was willing to pay for an upgrade. The flight was uneventful, and it's the first time I've been let down by Qantas, so I'm still going to recommend the airline, especially as it's one of the safest.

This experience caused distress for our children who did not want to sit with strangers for the 10 hour journey home. One child was ill and needed help to administer medication when required and being separated from our children would’ve been inconvenient and cause undue stress for everyone. It is not acceptable for Qantas to charge us extra to book our seats ahead of the flight then not have those seats available when checking in.

The A380 looks a little average compared to the 1-2-1 configurations on major rivals but the seat does become fully flat and with the mattress provided it is quite comfortable and not too hard. However, I was very disappointed with the meal service. A 9.30pm departure is hardly 'late night' but the obvious objective was to cut down dinner to 'supper' and leave everyone to sleep and/or starve until breakfast. This is the longest commercial flight in the world and at 16 hours I need some proper meals! Supper was a cut down meal with a starter of nothing but lettuce, a basic main (e.g. toasted sandwich, paella bowl) and one choice of dessert. If you are hungry after that they only have chips and biscuits - no hot snacks like many other airlines in business. Having to pre-order breakfast may save cabin crew time but it comes across as working for their convenience, not yours. The presentation, offering and options were very poor for business class. Service was OK but went missing overnight. The armrest based TV is much smaller and poorer in quality than (say) SQ and CX and just gets in the way.

"""unethical and unprofessional""","An overbooking policy is commonplace enough, but do not assure a full-rate paying Qantas passenger 2 days prior to her flight that you will not put her at a later flight nor downgrade her to economy due to overbooking business class, and confirmed that everything is ok the day before the flight-  only for her to rock up on check in and be told that you can offer her a later flight or a downgrade. The very thing the Qantas rep promised will not happen. What is more, a Qantas staff slipped up. After first telling me it's because I was last to check in, after several question let slip that I was earmarked to be bumped.

"""Seat was comfortable""",Flew Qantas QF28 from Santiago to Sydney in Business Class. I selected a seat upstairs on the B747. Flight was relatively empty with only half the seats occupied. Flight crew were attentive and friendly. Meal options varied and well prepared. Slight delay on departing and offered extra drinks prior to departure. PJ's provided upon boarding.

Old plane, with old first class still in place and I chose seat 1A, a dated and dirty first class seat from last century. Proved perfect as I have a few broken ribs but crew were excellent and the seat is better than the other Skybeds in Business Class. Food was mediocre. Veal and potato pie, heavy entree. Fish main was overcooked and rubbery with horrible potatoes, didn't finish it or have desert. Pre landing snack of noodle was pleasant. Really limited IFE.

"""really tried to like Qantas""","I've really tried to like Qantas, but they really try to make that difficult. We applied for an upgrade but never heard back, despite the website promise. They had no rep at Vienna where the trip started, and Emirates (their alliance partner) couldn't access their system. We are a couple, booked together, so just for good measure they put us in different rows. Singapore Airlines welcome you with a hot towel and keeps the service coming. Qantas offers you warm cordial out of a jug Aeroflot-1970s style. This is a 12.26 hour service. The food consisted of a small chicken wrap (in a no-name box), a small packet of potato crisps and an indiscriminate assortment of edible things from different manufacturers, called dinner. It's the first international flight I've ever got off feeling hungry. The seat was broken. The flight attendant wouldn't take his hands out of his pockets as he strolled up and down the isle - never, of course, actually carrying anything. But the worst of all was that this was Grand Final day in Melbourne, and they didn't even know who had won, for heavens sake. Oh, and finally, Melbourne went onto daylight saving three hours after we arrived.

"""Seat was average comfort and leg room""","We flew Qantas from Sydney to Heathrow via Dubai (QF1) in Economy. Had flown from Brisbane to catch this flight and arrival and transit were perfect. Boarded in Sydney easily and left on time. We had window and middle seats, and aisle seat was occupied. Seat was average economy in regards to comfort and leg room - didn't expect anything different. Was able to sleep on and off the whole way to Dubai. The A380 is such a quiet and smooth plane. Have done several flights to LAX on the Boeing 747, and this is so much quieter. (Do prefer the 747 though for seat comfort and legroom though). The crew to Dubai were excellent - service was efficient, cheerful and nothing seemed to hard. Our meals were all quite tasty and we weren't left feeling hungry. Drinks were offered regularly, and wines, coffees, soft drinks were all available. Empty trays were quickly removed. Definately give that sector 5 stars. Dubai to Heathrow sector was different. The crew were welcoming and happy, but the service once in the air was not as good as previous flight. Meals were still good, but slow in coming and not quite hot enough. No wine was offered at all on this flight (which would have made the remaining 7 hours flying time more relaxing and helped sleep a bit more). Breakfast was brought around when we started descending which we thought was not well planned. Felt like we had to rush so trays could be removed before landing. No second coffees were offered - after nearly 27 hours in the air, another beverage would have been appreciated. This crew just didn't seem to be as efficient as previous crew. Would still fly Qantas when possible as we have found that the majority of flights and crew are efficient, professional and cheerful.",0,8,Julie Lawton,2015-09-23,yes,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,SYV toLHR via DXB,September 2015,4,4,5,4,4,Qantas Airways

I've never had a Qantas flight leave on time - this might be just bad luck on my part but delays mean that I've missed connecting flights and work delays. They cancel flights on this leg or change planes at the last minute meaning pre-reserved seats are not honoured or even worse being bumped off the flight. The worst delay I had was for 22 hours on my return leg which was frustrating. Qantas never apologise for these delays.

Qantas Airways customer review,"Qantas has varying standards of product offered on the same domestic route. Qantas currently service the east/west route with Boeing 737-800s, A330s fitted with older seats, and A330s fitted with the newest business suite. Passengers booking a business class ticket don't quite know which experience they'll get. To make it worse, while Qantas has a number of newer and updated Boeing 737s in its fleet, it regularly rosters older Boeing 737s on the east/west route. These aircraft lack video on demand and current-gen seating.

Qantas Airways customer review,"Whilst many reviews are negative, my whole experience was great. (Compared to a previous flight 5 years ago which made me hesitant). Check in and departure faultless. Plane not too full on way to LAX so could lie down. Service was very good, and amusing. Had ordered Vegetarian Meal, but on reflection would opt for regular meal next time. No amenities kit offered, but then I always take my own items so no problems. Arrival a little late into LAX but priority bag tags on luggage so transfers easy. Return to Australia however had a bit of drama, due to fog in Sydney, flight from LAX to NYC delayed, which meant about a 10 hour wait in the very boring JFK. Qantas were great and handed out food vouchers, we were informed of delay, but I was already en route to JFK. Flight change over quick when it did arrive, only to find power outage at LAX meant that pax had to be checked in manually on a list. After about 2.5 hours wait we were on our way, but again due to missed connections we flew in to Sydney instead of Melbourne and there was a super effort to get everyone home on earliest flights they could. As this whole thing was due to weather it was not Qantas fault and I thought they did a great job in the circumstances. Staff were great and service very good.

Small touches as addressing by name..Mr X. Downsides, I was in seat 24J which is right next to the washroom so plenty of traffic coming past even though being an exit row there was nothing in front. Personal downside is that the IFE is stowed in the armrest and on the A380 service it is always nice to see take off and landing on the skycam which is not possible in PE or business.

Qantas Airways customer review,"I was very disappointed with the substandard Qantas service recently. After paying $US1200 for a one way Economy ticket and a further $25 for an aisle seat, I was most irritated by lack of attention to both passenger safety and comfort]. Only two of the 4 toilets were operating (the other two became unserviceable soon after the flight departed) to cater for probably at least 80 passengers. As a diabetic, it was a pathetic attempt by Qantas to not only understand the dietary needs of diabetics but to also provide a suitable meal. At one point soon after takeoff, the Flight Attendant brought round sweetened water. I questioned him as to whether there was any sugar in it and if so how much. He was unable to tell me as he admitted he didn't know. About an hour before the main cabin's dinner was served, the Flight Attendant brought an aluminium foil covered dish and plonked it down on my tray table. No water was offered nor served at that time. That was the meal, nothing else, not even a bread roll or a fruit dessert. My fellow non-diabetic passengers had what looked like a wonderful food fare. Then when a snack came for me, it was a huge banana and a sweet roll both not suitable for non-Insulin dependent diabetics. Breakfast was barely edible but by that stage I was so irritated and tired that I had lost my appetite. One positive point I will make was that the Economy male cabin staff on that flight were attentive to me and my diabetic needs throughout the flight but they are not the ones who create the diabetic meals.",0,4,H Johnson,2015-08-12,no,Economy Class,Business,LAX to Brisbane,July 2015,2,1,3,5,1,Qantas Airways

These should be readily available as in times past. Unfortunately only one main meal was served on this leg, plus what could only be described as a snack.

Perhaps I have been spoiled with Air NZ over time as a frequent flier with additional legroom in Space+ seats, but it was unbelievably cramped in economy. The food served was also average which there was no option not to pay for as with other airlines, something I like being a lower base fare. Movie and entertainment selection was good, but didn't change the comfort levels much during flight. Overall, average flight, nothing fantastic, and wouldn't change my loyalty to Air NZ anytime soon, who I feel overall have a better product on the Tasman.",0,5,N Hodgson,2015-07-16,no,Economy Class,Business,Auckland to Melbourne,June 2015,1,3,3,3,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,"My husband and I just returned from Munich to Melbourne via Dubai. We flew in Business class from Dubai and we were disappointed in all respects with the flight. The seats are not very conformtable, the television screen had to be stored away when preparing for landing, and don't mention the food, so much about Neil Perry's menu! Very poor in all respects. We haven't flown with Qantas for some time, as we frequently travel to Europe and want the most direct route. Now that Qantas fles to Dubai we thought we would try - but never again. Poor services, poor seating, poor food. Not worth the money",0,1,Mercedes Bredin,2015-07-13,no,Business Class,Couple Leisure,Dubai to Melbourne,July 2015,2,1,4,1,1,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,"I had a faultless fight going over to LA very impressed with the 747. Going home arrive at LAX to check in to be told my wife is seated on the other side of the plane (we booked and paid for flight two months ago and seats) they found 2 seats together, got to gate I was refused 3 times to board the plane, the seat wasn't working wouldn't lay flat yet someone was in the seat the whole flight. Cabin service was the worst I have had. For $8500 a ticket it did not reflect at all what they say on there web site.

Qantas Airways customer review,"Delayed by 10 hrs found out accidentally after check-in when I noticed the boarding pass of the connecting flight showing 19.50 instead of 09.50 (initially thought it was a misprint). No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubai–Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks – wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter – they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.",0,3,Joern Sauer,2015-07-10,no,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,Frankfurt to Sydney via Dubai,July 2015,3,2,1,4,2,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,"After putting up with disgraceful Emirates sub-standard service from London to Dubai, then from Dubai to Narita, we were never so happy to board our Qantas flight from Narita to Sydney. My family and I just sat back and relaxed on Qantas, following a multitude extremely rude bumbling incompetence by Emirates that saw us stranded in Dubai for almost a day. Once again the helpful, friendly and professional Qantas staff in Australia went above and beyond to resolve the Emirates problems we had encountered. Qantas staff were both on the ground and in the air very friendly and professional. Food, drinks and service excellent during the flights, the Business Class flatbeds allowed for comfortable sleep for the 9.5 hour journey. A little bit more variety with the onboard movies I think would help particularly when travelling with children, however not a bad selection overall.

I would like the crew to explain the features of premium economy. On our flight out we did not know that the metal footrest once fully extended then ratchets back up which allows you to have your feet and legs elevated, a great plus. Thankfully we knew this in our way home, but it wouldn't be very hard to inform passengers. Meals, crew all good.

Ground staff checking in passengers  very professional. Boarding went okay and found we had seats with extra legroom. Gluten free meal and snacks given as requested, which I find good. Cabin crew seemed friendly and asked me to complete a survey. Los Angeles to Brisbane flight took off late due to being informed by pilot that passenger didn't turn up, so had to offload bags. My husband had to ask for power outlet for Cpap which had been arranged by special handling Sydney end - cabin crew thought he said extra safety belt, and she brought him that. Gluten free meal for me given and snack in a bag. Husband missed out on first drink run - didn't get asked.

My family and I flew QF 41 and 42 last year and we felt the same aircraft was used (A330). What we disliked most was the TV monitor which looks decent and small and AVOD selection (no asian songs). I guess we do not get any amenities like used to. Toilets only provide liquid soap. As for food and beverages, I can not complain. On Sydney - Christchurch sector VV, there were only three cabin crews serving more than one hundred passengers. The crews looked young. They tried their best to serve, 10 minutes before landing ice cream was still being distributed.

Aircraft new and well kept with comfortable seating. Boarding was fine and departure on-time. Although seats quite close together for such a long flight the leg room was good due to IFE being kept out of the way. Meals were pretty good and staff came around offering snacks and drinks regularly. IFE excellent - I found a good range of films and my kids were kept happy for the whole flight as well. They did most things well, but a few little things let them down: - Not enough immigration forms for all passengers. (Honestly, they know the number of pax on a flight, it can't be that hard) - When I asked for an amenities kit about 1.5 hrs before landing, they told me they had run out. - Flight path maps weren't working so it was hard to tell where we were.

Qantas Airways customer review,"WLG-SYD went smoothly enough. Boarding in Sydney was shambolic. Staff announced that boarding would be by row number but didn’t enforce that, so people mucking around with luggage in the forward rows really held up boarding. Departure was somewhat delayed as a result. They also didn’t have arrival cards for Japan available during the flight but handed them to us as we disembarked at Narita, which wasn’t particularly helpful. When I went to online check-in, it offered the option to pre-order the meal for the SYD-NRT leg, so I opted for the No meal – I don’t want to be disturbed option, as this was an overnight flight leaving at 21.30. A flight attendant duly came up to me to ask me what my “special meal request” was. Something is not working with the pre-order option, as I had a similar thing happen on the return journey. As I got a really good promotional fare, the inconveniences outlined above were bearable, but they're not what I expect of a full-service airline.",0,7,Denise Stephens,2015-06-28,yes,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,Wellington to Tokyo via SYD,May 2015,4,4,2,3,5,Qantas Airways

After take-off when the flight attendant came around with water, I asked if there was a problem with the air-conditioning and was told that it was due to the plane sitting on the ground all day in the sun. The flight attendant moved me to a seat further forward which was cooler. On SYD-WLG leg, I’d pre-ordered my meal, as the option was offered when I went to online check-in.

Contrary to previous flight (SYD-SCL) in Premium Economy, the cabin crew (CC) offered no help to store hand luggage in overhead locker despite seeing my difficulty in doing so. Despite ample space in front of my seat to move around, staff disturbed passengers next to me by passing and collecting from them my food trays, until I politely asked them to step around to my seat to do so - which they did but offering no apology for their carelessness. Food was the worst consisting of fish or meat, a hard bun and a dry dessert - no salad, butter or cheese.

One main meal with not the usual extras that most airlines offer. Instead food spaced out with small apple and icecream on offer later on. Ater several hours were given 2 bite size beef sliders and drink as a snack meal. Water and juices bought around once early on during the flight. Seats were ok and cabin crew ok.

One attendant even knocked on the lavatory door and asked me to replace a toilet roll. Almost all attendants on both flights were not friendly, had sour faces and very straight to the point. They did not address anyone with Sir or Madam but just asked coffee, tea or hot chocolate? The inflight entertainment was quite boring and showed outdated movies.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew BNE-LAX-JFK on Sat 9 May 2015 and returned on Mon 18 May 2015 (arriving in Brisbane on Wed 20 May 2015). Three of the four sectors experienced delays - engine trouble airport congestion and fog. Qantas kept us informed of the situations in each case but this added hours onto already long sectors. Next time I will stop over in LA in case of delays and to break up the long journey. On each sector I had a spare seat next to me (on the aisle of the four middle seats) which makes a huge difference in comfort. Each sector was flown in a 747 Jumbo - only one sector was on an unrefurbished plane. Ashtrays in the toilet make me giggle. Happy with the flight attendants service food and entertainment. LAX airport has been refurbished since I was last there in 2010 and is a much happier experience. JFK Terminal 7 prior to security has no cafes restaurants etc so don't plan on sitting at the airport for any length of time before checking in.

Qantas Airways customer review,Sydney - Shanghai - Sydney on economy on May 2015 was one of my least favourite flight experiences. The seats were very worn out the screens were ridiculously small (tinier than an iPad Air) and in-flight movie choices were so limited I watched Big Hero 6 twice. Service was ok but I have experienced much better service on Emirates or Singapore airlines. As Qantas is the only one offering direct flights to Shanghai (code share with China Eastern) there's no other choices for time poor travellers. I dread to be on that plane again - my colleague didn't even want to fly Qantas anymore if she had a choice and we have to go again in July. Qantas has truly disappointed us especially on such a long haul - 11 hours plus with no entertainment.,0,1,N Lim,2015-06-04,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,3,3,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,MEL-SYD SYD-MEL. Qantas exceeded my expectations this time around. Our flight to Sydney was great the food could have been better just a cookie pretty ordinary for a 9am flight. The service was great though and friendly. Even better we had had personal seatback IFE. Flight back SYD-MEL no personal seatback IFE but again great service and was pleasantly surprised to receive a lovely chicken wrap on our 2.30pm flight and complimentary alcohol.,0,8,L Lopez,2015-06-01,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,"QF27 from SYD to SCL. Cabin crew old and tired and obviously hating their job. In spite of being a trip to South America some if not most members couldn't speak Spanish and I heard one woman answering rudely to a passenger asking for help to locate her seat (many passengers were senior tourists and visitors returning to S.A). Faulty and old-tech inflight entertainment best food choices finished early leaving last passengers with a non- edible salad that others had rejected. I will never again travel with this airline.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew Business Class from Melbourne to London (with stop over at Dubai). The first and longest leg was dreadful. The female cabin crew member who was demonstrating safety procedures just scowled. Not offered much to drink. Man next to me made his bed flat and strapped himself in clearly not wanting to be disturbed. I sat watching the rather small screen entertainment and closed my eyes occasionally. Was I asked if I wanted a meal? No. When I realised I had missed food I was told service had finished so had a whisky instead. Business Class? We weren't able to land in Dubai so circled for a long time before diverting to Bahrain to refuel. Waited there and flew back. This added over four hours to flying time. I was given one can of ginger beer in that time (and that was offered with a scowl). The seats were all right but nothing special. The service was diabolical. In many years of flying all across the world this cabin crew was one of the worst I have encountered and did nothing for the reputation of Qantas. On the second leg Dubai to Heathrow however the cabin crew were polar opposite: friendly and helpful. Food was nothing special though. I used Qantas with great expectations and found it wanting.,0,3,George Whyte,2015-05-31,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,2,2,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew QF1 SYD to Dubai - Very disappointed with this trip. Seat was uncomfortable and narrow. No pre dinner drink now only a welcome cordial. I pre ordered dinner and it was overcooked and barely warm when served. It was tasteless and simply the worse airline meal I have experienced. The arrival refreshment in to Dubai was average. The entertainment system was good. The crew were indifferent. Most didn't seem to want to be there and did very little on this flight. Overall was expecting far more from Qantas especially after experiencing the improvement within the domestic business. I transferred to an Emirates flight (Qantas flight number) and they are certainly miles ahead of Qantas. I am due to fly Qantas to America later on in the year and I am not looking forward to it.

Qantas Airways customer review,QF 98 HKG-BNE on new interior A330. My first flight with Qantas and very pleased. New seats have top notch entertainment system and a foot bag underneath the seat in front of you which I found brilliant. Crew was very warm and accommodating I went into the galley mid-flight for a snack and the FA heated a muffin up for me in the oven. I found the new meal service without the trays refreshing. 3 healthy choices for both breakfast and dinner I for instance had an excellent duck noodle salad. 5 different wines on offer! Only downside I found was the outrageous 25 AUD$ charge for seat selection. But will absolutely fly them again when in the region.,0,9,F Kleinen Hammans,2015-05-27,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF18 (JFK to SYD via LAX) and QF431 (SYD to MEL) on 2015/05/18-20. Despite the fact that both of the first two legs of the trip delayed by more than an hour we were kept relaxed and calm by the nice cabin crew who helped us rebook our connecting flights. Nobody onboard actually complained about the lengthy delays. However I soon discovered I was on an older B747 aircraft the entertainment system was difficult to use onboard as it wasn't a touchscreen and it crashed often. The whole design of the interface also resembled an old computer operating system from the 1980s-90s. There was also not a lot of choice of movies compared to the QF A380. When I was watching a movie it got stuck quite often. However despite all this I have not lost faith in QF as a preferred airline.,0,8,L Sun,2015-05-27,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,4,N/A,5,3,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,I regularly travel on QF497 Sydney to Melbourne. I choose this flight as it is the last flight to Melbourne and I can take advantage of a whole day in Sydney. Being a late departure the Qantas Terminal is always quiet so check in and security is a breeze. Qantas gate staff are forever pleasant and welcoming. Onboard depending on which day you'll fly in a 737-800 or Airbus A330 aircraft pushback is quick and before you know it supper is served attentive crew and always on time. Highly recommend this flight for any late departures back to Melbourne.,0,10,D Angelevski,2015-05-25,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,5,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Just done a trip from Sydney to New York on QF11 and return to Brisbane on QF 16 in business class. The aircraft from Sydney was meant to be an A380 but this was switched to a reconfigured 747. Was a bit disappointed but the crew and service was great on both legs. I think Qantas must have done some retraining as they were friendly efficient and happy to be there ( which hasn't always been the case). Lie flat seat was comfortable and I was able to sleep well Food was tasty on all legs the menu variety was worthy of business class. Crew topped up wine regularly. Would recommend Qantas this time although it is expensive.,0,9,D Lobo,2015-05-25,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF93 and QF11 MEL-LAX-JFK 14/5/2015. Everything about this flight was impeccable. From information to passengers about the short delay ex MEL through to the professional and attentive service by all crew encountered both flights were close to full it seemed. I'm 6ft and had no problem with my economy seat so can't really understand other peoples comments regarding space issues. Just ensure you do your seat exercises and wander around periodically. Only gripe were the transfer procedures at LAX that needs a rethink so it's not a bun rush. All in all a rather peasant 21/22 hour experience.

Qantas Airways customer review,Darwin to Perth on 737-800 with winglets. This flight time has never changed leaving Darwin at 2.20pm and with the 90 minute time difference gets into Perth a bit before 5pm. Flight is always fantastic. The cabin crew are always great food is top notch plus flight is long enough to watch films. Oh and they always serve free wine and beer. Nice for a mid-afternoon flight of nearly four hours. There is always a choice of mains - had a very nice soy chicken dish with vegetable fried rice. Still all the nice little sides of bread roll and butter cheese and crackers and as it was Easter Saturday a Lindt Easter Egg. Nice touch! Mars Bar ice-cream later on. Can never fault this flight one that I have flown now for twelve years. Always look forward to it.,0,10,Paul Williss,2015-05-20,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,I have used Qantas frequently and always been satisfied but QF161 Sydney-Wellington on May 12 was disappointing. The meals offered were a disappointing choice and the lamb/broccoli that I thought sounded the best was terrible. The 2 people sitting next to me didn't eat theirs either!

Qantas Airways customer review,Just completed a return trip to Singapore out of Brisbane so not a long flight. This is my fifth trip overseas and first with Qantas. I don't believe I will be doing anymore trips with Qantas because they simply do not come close to the competition airlines such as Thai Airways or Singapore Airways.

Qantas Airways customer review,QF29 MEL to Hong Kong on one of the refurbished A330. We were in Business class and the new seat layout of 1-2-1 is great. The new seats are very comfortable with plenty of room and storage space. We had window seats so sat one behind the other. This offers every other seat right up against the window with the storage on the aisle side and the other seats the opposite where they sit against the aisle (with the potential to be bumped) with the storage against the window. If you are a window viewer make sure you pick the right seat configuration. The crew were great but the lunch meal was below Qantas standard. I had fish and it was dry and tasteless. Their wine selection was great so it was the food part of the meal that was the let down. Entertainment was great and the flight was on time and drama free.,0,8,W Coenik,2015-05-13,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,2,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,I flew Qantas QF27/28 in economy to and from Santiago on the 8 October 2014 and 5 January 2015 respectively. The QF27 leg to SCL was fantastic. At the counter my oversize baggage was checked in without issue. The food was great and it seemed like every hour or so crew were coming around with desserts ice creams or drinks. The crew dealt with a drunk unruly passenger seated in front of me in an assertive way and the CSM disarmed the situation. The staff seemed to strike that balance of being friendly and getting on with the job in an efficient manner. As we approached Santiago from the south the Andes came into view on the right - definitely choose the right side of the plane if flying QF27! This would have to be one of the most scenic long-haul flights in the world and certainly gave an adventurous feel to the beginning of my 3-month holiday. Coming back the other way on QF28 I again had awesome views of the Andes from the left-side of the plane as we tracked very far south over Chile's Patagonian archipelago. One negative I would highlight is the price. The fare to South America is generally expensive so it's worthwhile waiting for a sale. I paid $2350 return but have a sale fare booked next year for $1600 in Jan/Apr. It helps if you travel a few weeks either side of Christmas. Staying on cost Qantas charges for seat selection. For me it's window seat or nothing so I didn't mind coughing up $25 each way but its worth noting that competitor LAN offers free seat selection. Lastly the entertainment selection is good but the provided headphones only provided sound through one ear. Combined with the roar of the 747's engines at the back of the plane I couldn't really settle into a movie as I was straining to hear the audio. I flew LAN's 787 within South America and the quietness of that aircraft made watching movies much easier. Something to consider now that LAN flies the 787 on the SYD-AKL-SCL route. On the flip-side its comforting to know you're on the tried and tested four-holer 747 as you cross the deserted Southern Ocean (and you don't need to make the stop at AKL making for a quicker flight).,0,9,Paul Brodie,2015-05-12,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,April 10 QF10 Dubai to Melbourne. I have been a Qantas customer and frequent flyer for many years. On this particular trip together with my 9 year old son coming back from a holiday in Europe the disappointment with this leg of the flight was big. We been pampered from Frankfurt to Dubai by Emirates and then continued on Qantas back home. During this 13 hour flight the provision of food and drinks was poor. No child meal despite request one warm meal 11 hours after boarding before only snags and one pizza slice. No trace of the crew occasionally they pass through. The one warm meal was just one aluminium tray no sides. The service on QF10 was to be expected from a budget airline but here we paid well above the budget flights.

Qantas Airways customer review,We flew to Santiago Chile in Jan 2015 by Qantas on Premium Economy. After having flown LAN several times in the past I have to take my hat off to Qantas for the quality of their service and their professionalism.

Qantas Airways customer review,Recently flew the Dubai-Sydney leg of our European trip on Qantas with my husband and 17 month old. I was so impressed by the friendliness of the crew particularly towards those of us with young children. Their attention warmth and smiles really made me feel comfortable and that help was at hand if needed. This was in stark contrast to the crew members of the other airline we took on our outbound flight and Paris-Dubai leg. The entertainment was good and included the favourite shows of my daughter which was a real plus. As airline food goes it wasn't fantastic but better than expected.

Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-MEL. I don't think there is a single airline in the world today that can offer a domestic economy experience on a short haul flight as good as that on last nights QF477. Smooth flight comfortable seating genuinely engaging flight attendants excellent food and wine. Not the worlds most advanced IFE on this older B737-800 but I know most of the fleet is getting upgraded. The new hot food service box pack is excellent and the quality has clearly been improved- Coconut Chicken curry last night or a prosciutto salad.

Qantas Airways customer review,"BNE to Singapore. Checking in using machines just about everyone needed assistance. The seat allocation for my husband and I were many rows apart. Everyone ended up at the bag drop where this problem was sorted. A330 Airbus was cramped tired ditto the crew. Food less than ordinary no tray but just main meal container (one was cracked) plus roll and envelope with cutlery etc. Overheard passenger asking cabin crew member to recommend which of the meal choices - the reply was ""Madam I would recommend eating before you board the plane""! The pre- landing snack was a sort of pizza contained in a thick cardboard box - made in England. Entertainment programme was minimal. Return flight fortunately on a rather more modern plane better range of entertainment but the crew were brusque uncaring and disorganised - would not feel confident about them in a crisis.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew MEL-LAX and return on the A380 service in Premium Economy. After seeing some mixed reports this was a very pleasant surprise. The outward flight was on the upper deck which in Premium Economy had a bit more room and was a bit quieter than the return flight which was downstairs in Premium Economy. Both flights left and arrived right on time. In the A380 this is a very good product with the seating and comfort level almost the equivalent of older generation Business class. The cabin crew and the service were excellent the food good without being remarkable and the in-flight entertainment also excellent. This is very good value for the money especially if you book early enough when the prices tend to be lower.

With typical Qantas efficiency all flights departed and arrived on time and luggage was first off the carousel. Staff pleasant and professional. It's a shame that cost-cutting is so obvious - being handed a bottle of water instead of in a glass is so downmarket.

Qantas Airways customer review,Sydney-London-Melbourne on A380 with a family group of six ranging from grandparents (includes me) to parents to two 11 year old grandchildren. Originally booked QF9/10 from/to Melbourne but QF9 was cancelled some months prior to departure apparently as an occasional cost-saving measure by Qantas. Hence we were moved to QF1 from Sydney for the outbound leg with a domestic connecting flight in Business. Overall an excellent experience that includes the chauffeur transfer services spa and massage facilities at the First Lounge in Sydney personal escort to the aircraft warm friendly and genuine personal greetings by all cabin staff and Customer Service Managers on each leg great menu options top wines and spirits good entertainment facilities spacious individual suites and very comfortable beds. All staff were magnificent - efficient cheerful always checking if anything else could be done and they had great fun interacting with the children (and vice a versa). The only downside that prevents me from giving full star ratings overall was a couple of us had to queue for the toilets a couple of times because they were being used by Business Class passengers from upstairs. Obviously a legacy from when Qantas decided to replace two of the Business Class toilets upstairs with seats. I'm sure someone in the Qantas executive could identify a simple solution to this annoyance. In summary Qantas can be very pleased with the manner in which all staff looked after us.,0,8,Jim O'Hara,2015-04-14,yes,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,What has happened to you Qantas? Plane to Bangkok was old and hadn't been cleaned from previous passengers. The in-flight entertainment was not competitive with other airlines. Lots of trouble returning from our destination due to flight delays (mostly of a technical nature). When transferring there are no Qantas desk people to ask for information as we had two international connections and our flight was delayed twice. Absolutely no Qantas desks open to talk to a human being. Ended in up the Qantas lounge with our disgruntled passengers. Flight finally took off 7 hours later at 1.30 in the morning (due to radar part being flown in for our plane) hence we missed our two international connections. They tried to correct but we had to drive to our final destination in the end as we had missed our last flight and Qantas say they probably won't pay for the car rental. We will never fly with them again. They need to upgrade their planes and service because at present they are not competing with the other airlines.,0,1,Woodham Maria,2015-04-12,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,2,1,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,MEL-AKL-MEL. Onward journey to Auckland was on Emirates EK406/QF8762 was on 23rd March 2015. The aircraft was an Airbus 380. I have flown these before and it was very comfortable. The flight was full the service was excellent the food was great and the cabin entertainment was terrific. I have flown Emirates many times and considered them to be a 5 star airline because of their quality of service the food and the ambience. However the fight back to Melbourne was on Qantas QF 154 on 26th March 2015. It was like chalk and cheese. The aircraft was a Boeing 737. The flight was full and it was cramped. There were many people flying back to Melbourne from Auckland after the cricket - I couldn't understand why Qantas were not able to have a larger aircraft. The food and service was pretty ordinary to say the least. I would like to fly Qantas again as it is the national carrier - but goodness me they have to really lift their game and compete with the rest of the world.,0,2,Sena Gooneratne,2015-04-06,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,2,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,London Heathrow to Dubai in Airbus 380 - I did use Cathay first lounge at terminal 3 which was ok. Boarding was very easy for first and business class - welcome onboard was very friendly with premium bubbles of the day being generously offered in first. Flight attendants very friendly ample explanation of the seat and entertainment facilities. Very nice amenity set with pyjamas and slippers. Meal was good with very good Australian white wines - coffee accompanied by premium liquors and Bordeaux styled canelécookies. Assistance was given for sleep position - flight is only 6.50 - so after the meals only able to sleep for 4 hours. Light breakfast served before arrival was of good quality goodbye was also friendly. Luggage arrived very fast in Dubai airport.,0,9,M Vermeire,2015-04-04,yes,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF36 Singapore-Melbourne 30 March 2015 leaving at 7.55pm. Business class. One would expect dinner on a flight leaving at this time - no such luck! Offerings were a cheese plate a beef burger a bowl of capsicum soup and two others which I cant recall. No entree no dessert atrocious service all a bit of an effort from the older female flight attendant who clearly had lost her enthusiasm for the job. Dinner was served in economy however. No pinot noir on trolley just a shiraz and cab sav it is very clear where a large proportion of the profit has come from. The passenger experience irrespective of the cabin should be your biggest marketing tool Qantas It's a shame to see an icon spiralling into mediocrity. As a gold frequent flyer of long standing we will be looking to the opposition for domestic.,0,1,Sue A Ruskin,2015-04-04,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,1,N/A,1,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF 24 - BKK-SYD an Emirates code share flight. Ok meal is rather sad tiny portion for Larb chicken salad as a main meal for dinner they had run out of the better option which was Choo Chee sea bass. Luckily I packed myself some goodies from Bangkok Gourmet supermarket. However I have to give top marks for ingenuity as I love the hot chocolate offered as an option to coffee or tea. Entertainment is the old school loop back movies on tiny screens simply not worth watching. Music collection is rather sad and limited a drastic contrast to those who are so accustomed to the Emirates ICE system. While Emirates would get 5 star on entertainment sadly I can only give 1 star for Qantas. Plane is old but immaculate no mood lighting no tooth paste in the toilet. Seat is cramp. Despite this I am glad sitting on the aisle seat and manage to sleep for a good few hours. The Qantas seat is definitely better than the one emirates deploy on their Airbus 330-200 which will give you a guaranteed back ache if ever attempted on a 9 hours flight. But top marks for the crews they save the short coming of the hard products.,0,6,Martin Hiu,2015-04-04,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,BKK-SYD QF24 on 25 March in economy. Flight experience was reasonably sad: despite being Platinum FF no recognition at all from cabin crew however some special treatment for a young woman a few seats behind being showered with champagne dinner from business class and noise cancelling headphones. Food more mediocre than anything breakfast as good as non-existent (although there should have been a 'mushroom cheese and thyme breakfast pastry' and some 'yoghurt and pineapple compote' cabin crew conveniently served me nothing but a cup of coffee). Plane (A333) old seats cramped flight completely full. No comparison to what EK offers in economy both in terms of aircraft and service.,0,2,Claus Dirnberger,2015-03-28,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,1,2,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-BKK QF23 on A330 16 Feb. Flight 80% full. Counter check-in service achieved the desired results with seat selection at least they were window and aisle seats seated in 57 J & K with a feeling of space because of the wider aisle. As for the flight. Departed a little early the captains announcements were clear and audible that initially he expected to arrive early but due to some storm cell in the tropics he chose to navigate around we arrived on time. Very smooth flight. This Qantas flight was the best I have experienced with them in the past 12 years or so. Meals which were tasty edible and plentiful were served with a good range of drinks within 1.5 hours of departure. Seat comfort good and to our enjoyment on this daytime flight of 9 hours the PAX in front did not recline their seats into my face. I did notice that the crew automatically asked other PAX to put their seat in an upright position during meal times. The cabin crew in the rear section of economy class had a positive attitude for the duration of the flight and worked tirelessly and with enthusiasm. They were approachable jovial friendly professional communicative genuinely interested and most importantly personable. They were fun to fly with and made this a most pleasant flight Compared to some major competitor airlines with good service but rather robotic - like cabin crew these crew were a refreshing change and significantly an improvement over other Qantas flights experience in recent years. In conclusion a most pleasant and relaxing flight - and clearly worth the extra money over so - called “low cost”airlines. I will be definitely flying with them again in the foreseeable future.,0,9,Piddick Kevin,2015-03-23,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,"Flew business from Sydney to Manila return in March 2015 on A330-200. Excellent crew - attentive service and very friendly especially on return leg. A330 cabin is showing its age and the current refit Qantas are undergoing much needed. Seat comfortable and managed 4 hours sleep on return flight home. Wines were great and food quality was high. Qantas really need to rethink their approach to business menu. It is all a bit fussy and a hearty ""home style"" dish would not go amiss. I understand that the flights from Asia are a challenge to do a full service get time for rest and breakfast but when leaving a city like Manila at 7.20pm after a day working passengers haven't had dinner and both Manila airport and Qantas lounge are woeful with no decent food options a supper service really doesn't cut it when as best you haven't eaten since lunch. It could easily be fixed with a hearty meal with decent portions. Otherwise very good.",0,7,Derek Cummins,2015-03-20,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,5,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF27 SYD to Santiago Business in a 747-400. Penny pinching catering. Generally inferior to catering in Qantas business domestic. Staff apologetic agree used to be much better. Doing the best they can with what they have. Agreed Neil Perry selection going downhill. Often can't offer a choice of mains. Allocated one 400 ml bottle of water per passenger 5 cashews plus some other rubbish in a cellophane pack. No comparison with airlines like Emirates. Could do much better for minimal cost in comparison to the fare. Recommend Qantas but eat before you fly.,0,8,G Bethune,2015-03-20,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,My husband and I recently flew to Sydney New Zealand and Dubai from the UK (round trip) and booked with Emirates some of our flights were on a Qantas aircraft and how they have changed over the last 25 years! I last flew with them back in the late 80's and back then couldn't rate them more highly. What a great airline they were even though I flew economy I was treated as if I was in first class. Now I would compare them to Ryanair or some such other cheap airline. They really pack you in like sardines even on long haul (7 hour plus flights) most of these flights left us in physical pain from being so squashed in. The aircraft's are looking old and tired. We nearly didn't get on one flight (Sydney to Queenstown) as they had over booked it. The ground crew did try their best to be helpful and we did finally manage to make it onto the flight but had to be rushed through even though we'd arrived a good 2.5 hours before our flight. They weren't able to seat us together which is so disappointing when you have booked seats in advance. I hate this level of poor service. I would never choose to fly with them again sadly.,0,1,C Foster,2015-03-20,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,1,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,I flew LHR-DXB-MEL. Compared to other 'western' carriers I found the service and product very high although I wish they would roll out a new seat. I had the opposite experience to N Jeram though regarding crew - I thought the London based crew (of whom were comprised of several 'aussies' as well as other nationalities) far superior to the Melbourne based crew who were extremely indifferent and did not seem to want to be there. I think it is ridiculous to only want crew from the nationality of the carrier serving you. For me one of the strengths of airlines like BA Emirates Singapore Cathay and Qantas is their multi-national crews.,0,7,D Jason,2015-03-20,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,3,3,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,QF2 on 28 Feb from LHR to SYD via DBX. Upgraded to Premium Economy on points. Small cabin. Attentive crews on both legs. Food is much improved and the quality of service is great. It is business lite rather than a super charged economy. Small touches. The CSM came around and personally welcomed each passenger by name. Usual supply of F & B on request. Quibbles are minor. The footrest is pretty much useless. It does not extend out to support the legs. A better solution may be to add also some support under the seat in front. I was stuck in the middle of three seats so not the best place to be. Definitely worth the extra. Have not tried the other PE services with other airlines so cannot compare but QF is now scoring goals.

Qantas Airways customer review,QF1 to London via DBX on 23 Feb. In the economy cabin QF have upped their game. The FA's were a great team from SYD to DBX and on hand to look after the folks in cattle (or coach depending on your persuasion). The quality of catering has improved since my last long haul on QF to Dallas in Dec 2014. A noticeable difference from DXB to LHR. Qantas persist in using a UK based crew. Service levels on that leg were indifferent at best. Sounded very much like being on one of the holiday shuttles to Spain. Note to Alan Joyce: this is an Australian airline. Even though I am a dual national (Aus/GB) I would much prefer an Aussie crew all the way. There is no way on earth a English crew can have the same feeling for Qantas. This is the reason why Emirates lag. They have a multinational crew who are in the UAE for the money. The only worthwhile engagement on the DXB to LHR leg was with an FA who was from Queensland.

Crews on SYD-CGK were friendly but not on CGK-SYD. Excellent wine selections. Managed to get a good sleep on CGK-SYD even though seat was angled. The breakfast on CGK-SYD was disappointing only muffin. I did not think it was up to Business class standard. Overall it was still a good value for money. But I had better experience with GA.

Cabin was very clean and new seats were very comfortable. Flight was very empty since it was an early morning flight. Cabin crew were very young and energetic with lots of enthusiasm to help. 20 minutes into the flight breakfast was served. A very delicious breakfast quiche yoghurt and orange juice. Cabin crew came around 4 times offering complimentary drinks and snacks which was amazing since this flight is only 2 hours and 15 minutes.

Qantas Airways customer review,QF23 Sydney to Bangkok QF24 return. The journey stared badly when upon checking in online I found that whilst my wife and I with the same names and same booking expected to be seated together this was not so. After much effort and huffing and puffing the consultant told me that it was bad luck I should have checked in earlier the plane was full but lucky me we could have the bassinet seats. Lucky us. The A330 is a disappointment at the price. Old seating not lie flat. My seat wouldn't fully recline and lets admit it it's an embarrassment compared to Emirates and the like. Tiny screen almost impossible to watch and a poor selection. On the return trip the controls wouldn't work. No priority boarding in Bangkok. No care at all. The upside is that the cabin staff were amazing and caring. Thanks! The food was compared to my last Emirates 380 Business flight just average.

Qantas Airways customer review,It was like flying two different airlines. The trip MEL-LAX on a 747/400 was an enjoyable experience. Food was great cabin crew could not have done more the toilet was clean and fresh. Sadly can not say the same for our return trip on A380 the cabin crew were just plain rude. No pre meal drink meal just slapped down half a glass of wine served with meal no offer of second glass. Tray cloth ripped of tray without being asked have you finished sadly there was a glass of Baileys on the tray it ended badly. Breakfast was worse when they finally got the order correct the toast was like cement the tea was cold and so strong you could have stained wood with it. Was too frightened to ask for another cup of tea due to the mood of the cabin crew. The A380 needs more toilets the ones available were dirty and smelly.

Qantas Airways customer review,I flew on Jan 29th from Perth to Sydney Sydney to LAX and on to PDX. I paid extra for an aisle seat by the emergency exit on the Sydney-LAX portion of my flight for extra leg room. After finding the two people seated next to me didn't pay any extra for their seats really upset me. Why did I have to pay so much more and they didn't pay anything. The flight attendants bumped into me every time they went up and down the aisle I couldn't sleep with this happening which made the flight that much longer. I hate to say how bad the food was on the flight. I had 3 meals served and only had a few bites of each meal. I was hoping for much more from Qantas and the extra money I'm out to upgrade was a waste. And having to pay for a seat that the other two people didn't have to pay extra for really was upsetting.

Qantas Airways customer review,"Flying from SYD to SIN early February on QF 81. Aircraft was A330. Positives: Food was very good and I like the new concept of serving meals in plastic bags instead of trays. More convenient and ease both passengers and FAs to distribute and clean up meals. Early notification of flight delay. Aircraft was old. IFE was very limited and the screen was small range of entertainment was very poor! I flew with Qantas several times on domestic flight and I can tell that the domestic aircraft's are way more better than international ones! Why keep this old ""expired"" aircraft for international flight? Although the cabin crew were very efficient doing their job I can hardly see any smile or hospitality in the service except from 1 or 2 people. Most of the staff seems like doing everything in a rush. Also unlike most Asian airlines I didn't see any staff squatting when talking to passengers. Flew with EK on my return flights (both flights booked with Qantas) and the overall services was way much better than Qantas!! There is a huge gap between those to and EK is leading far. Also considering that EK is now codeshared with QF and price are the same! In fact my EK flight was also booked through Qantas I would expect a slightly better services on QF side to match its counterpart.

Flights between Mel and Singapore were very comfortable good food and excellent service from cabin crew. Only disappointment was the poor IFE-limited choices and I struggled to find anything to watch. I expected more from Qantas! The Jetstar leg was uncomfortable and crowded and somewhat of a let down after paying for a business class fare-but luckily it is only a very short flight.

The first class cabin was not staffed properly to service a full occupied cabin and food was served cold after a long delay. The cabin attendants were long on apologies but short on service. The best explanation I received from the cabin staff was that First Class seats that had not been sold by flight time were given to their frequent flyers.

Qantas Airways customer review,QF1 Sydney to London. The seats are very good a little hard after 14 hours and recline fully though I slept better slightly upright. Downside is that they are built in pairs and you feel the movement of a fidgety neighbour.

Qantas Airways customer review,Many years ago I travelled with Qantas and I had a terrible experience staff were grumpy food was terrible. The whole flight was a nightmare. Since then whenever possible I would fly from Sydney to Europe with Singapore Air. Last year I made a trip home to UK with a few stops and various different airlines. On the way back from Manchester I few Finnair and then after a stop-over in Singapore flew Qantas to Sydney. I was amazed with the service I received from the ground staff as I had a baggage issue that Finnair did not want to deal with but Qantas came to the rescue. The flight was very comfortable as I am not a small woman I felt I wasn't being squeezed into a tiny space. The food was fantastic being a vegetarian normally the food served is so bad I never eat it but the caterer had the food spot on for a vegetarian who eats diary.

Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-BKK on an A330-300 that was not refurbished yet. While the interior updates are clearly due I thought this was a very good flight. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful. The meal (lunch) ice cream served afterwards and refreshment prior to arrival were great. IFE is dated but adequate and there was a reasonable choice for a 9-hour flight. Seat comfort and legroom was fine.

Did the USA theme parks and had a great time. Qantas staff on the flights were great with the kids. They asked the kids what they wanted to eat and drink and then combined some of the meal options from first and business to make sure the kids were well fed.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew economy from Melbourne to Brisbane return for the Australia day long weekend. Up on the Friday and back on the Monday. Got exit row seats up and back on a Boeing 737-8. Going up it was a 10am flight so only a light snack which was some nuts and a health bar of sorts. This must have been an old 737 as no inflight entertainment so listened to the radio. On time and a fuss free flight. Coming back on a newer Boeing 737-8 with inflight seat back screens. I still only listened to the radio. As it was a lunch time flight had a choice of a chicken sandwich or a soggy veggie pie. Again a fuss free flight and on time. I had checked in luggage which arrived without too much wait. Overall a good trip from Qantas.,0,8,W Coenik,2015-01-28,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,"MEL-WLG return in January 2015 on a B737-800. Cabin crew generally helpful (these routes are operated by New Zealanders rather than Australians) food and drink plentiful and hard to fault with several tasty selections. I had lamb kofta one way and lamb tagine the other. Even ice creams and chocolates were distributed after the main course - nice touches for economy class. Inflight entertainment better than average. Negatives were that both flights left around half an hour late with limited announcements and no obvious cause for delays other than the ""late arrival of the incoming flight"" mantra which airlines love bandying about these days. I'm not aware of being late to your last appointment being an acceptable excuse for being late to your next one in any other form of human activity. The other negative is the Qantas approach to pre-booked online seating. The tactic seems to be to open up very few seats in the hope that you will select an emergency exit at extra cost. I am happy so long as I have an aisle seat which took a bit of negotiation both flights and meant sitting next to the rear toilets. Incidentally I have never seen such long queues for toilets as I did on the return flight - two cubicles for 150 economy passengers is clearly inadequate on a four hour trip.",0,7,G Chin,2015-01-28,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,SYD to BKK 15th Jan. Return 19th Jan. Flight full both ways in both classes. Old plane hard seats poor food choices outbound-didn't eat on return sector. Outstanding mature crew on both sectors. This business class service is now way behind Thai Cathay Singapore etc. Marginally better than Jetstar Star Class.

Qantas Airways customer review,"A330-300 MEL-HKG QF29 HKG-MEL QF30. It was a quite old plane with very old seats and useless flight entertainment system. No hot towels neither refreshment wipes before the flight. Polite looking but unfortunately unhelpful cabin crew. I had a special request food but could not eat it because of the heavy spice taste and smell. I went to the kitchen and asked for something else to eat according to my special dietary requirements but got the answer ""there is nothing for you to eat on this plane"" rather then getting offered simply for a piece of fruit or a packet of crackers. The person in front of me asked for a spare bottle of water but was declined. Finally I have got the impression from the cabin crew that I have to enjoy with what I have got because they were too busy and unwilling to offer any more than that. This was my first flight experience with Qantas and because of couple of small problems it will probably be the last one.",0,3,A Kutlu,2015-01-26,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,1,N/A,2,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew Sydney-Melbourne late last week. I was shocked to be served a chicken and corn pie - it was awful Qantas has really hit rock bottom no alternative available like I would have had on other airlines outside Australia. The overall service is now much like American domestic carriers - little or no service at all! Staff gave little or no assistance to passengers trying to find locations for luggage storage overhead hence the flight was 10 min late before all passengers were settled. The seats also have an unusual shape which for a longer flight would become quite uncomfortable.

Qantas Airways customer review,We flew business class Perth to Sydney on Xmas Day and Sydney to Perth Jan 17 one may expect Xmas spirit. On the Perth to Sydney flight I asked the stewardess for a glass of water and champagne about 30 mins after takeoff and was told to wait till they served the food in half an hour. She then walked off and it took 10 mins to get another stewardess as they were all in the food area with the curtains shut. Finally got a drink of water and then when food came around I was informed that from a choice of 4 only 1 was available as they had run out of the others. It was a one third full business class section and we were the second to be served! I questioned this and she grumblingly walked off and found me an omelette. We never saw the staff without having to ring the bell. Sydney to Perth again I was told to wait until the meal was served before I could get a drink of juice and wine. I got better service in economy. But the male crew were fabulous friendly and brought us drinks without having to wait until the food was served. Seats were frayed and vinyl split some of the reclining buttons did not work. Food very average. Very poor female crew and overall and I will not fly Qantas business class out of choice ever again. I will go back to Singapore Cathay Air NZ and Virgin.,0,2,M Patt,2015-01-26,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,2,N/A,2,2,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,BNE-SIN. Economy. Pushed back nearly 40 mins late because of congestion at Brisbane airport and we also arrived late because of bad weather en-route. The IFE had a tiny seatback screen and I found it difficult to get a hang of how the menus worked. It was easy to accidentally knock the controls when seated. The new Qantas meals had not yet been introduced on this route but nevertheless the food and wine were of a very good standard for economy. However what really made the fight were the older and very professional cabin and flight crew who instilled complete confidence throughout.

Qantas Airways customer review,"London to Dubai A380. This was my first time on Qantas in many years as last time I flew them I felt they were very poor but have read how much they have invested in improving the product so wanted to try again. This was the first leg of a multi-leg journey in combination with partner airline Emirates which made for an interesting comparison. A380 although relatively new was starting to look tired inside. Dark carpets and dull seat colours made for a very dark gloomy interior. Seat comfortable but legroom surprisingly tight especially considering the long flying times Qantas international flights make. Inflight entertainment good sized touch screen tv screens with very good selection of movies TV music and games. Inflight entertainment on from gate to gate which is a great touch. Crew predominantly British friendly and professional. ""Supper"" service served from London to Dubai which essentially consisted of choice of hot main meal and small desert. Tasty meal but for an evening service where dinner would normally be served very limited. A tiny carrot muffin and juice served just before landing. Qantas are obviously cost cutting evident through their reduced meal service adding more rows into economy by removing a number of toilets at the rear of the A380 and lack of legroom. It was not a bad service or product but it could be so much better especially in line with what their partner Emirates offer.",0,6,Rob Cooper,2015-01-21,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-HKG 747 with the newer seats and IFE that you can start from the moment you sit down. Much more comfortable than the other older 747s and the same as the newer A380's. One thing that I really like about the newer Qantas economy seats is the footrest. It's like a spring-loaded hammock for your feet which I seen on no other airline and is much more comfortable. Staff attentive and I never had to wait. food was a bit better than expected (but who expects too much from Economy?). Still it was quite Ok. Departure was a little delayed but we caught up during the flight time and arrived on schedule so no issue.

Nice food in refurbished Darwin Qantas Club and beverages of course. Took some snacks on board including the Christmas tree shortbread biscuits.

Continued on to Darwin from Sydney after 4 hour stopover in Sydney Qantas Club as usual very nice food and drink selections in QC. 737-800 to Darwin plane seemed new plane was barely a third full so service was quick had a nice pasta dish for dinner.

Qantas Airways customer review,Perth-Sydney. Flight was on an A330-200 but we had to change planes because of malfunctioning landing gear. So I went back to the lounge which was ok but had a very poor food selection. We then changed planes to a former Jetstar A330 and got upgraded to business there were no TVs but rather iPads which didn't bother me. We then heard because of the delay we have no catering because it would take too long to load the food on the plane and if we put the food on we wouldn't beat the Sydney airport curfew. Because there was no food they had to use leftover pretzels and drinks from the other flight. Then when we taxied to the runway we had to return again because someone dropped their headphones which stopped the door from closing then we finally took off and the flight attendants didn't want to be disturbed (which I don't blame them) but they where still quite responsive and they had a great sense of humour. Business class was bad but at least Qantas is upgrading them to a much better looking product. Overall the experience was bad but they where very responsive and happy to help.

Qantas Airways customer review,HKG-SYD-PER-SYD-HKG: Contrary to the previous comment left by J Rose. I got lucky and had the A380 on both international legs. The service and seat comfort are superb! The food portion tend to be a bit small because of budget cutting but asking for second helping is never a problem with them. Very good wine served on board and topped up frequently. The A380 flat bed is very comfortable and provided several hours of decent sleep. Entertainment system is fine too with a vast array of choices to keep me happy. They give out express card to speed up the process at the immigration I was able to drop the bags again and relax at the domestic lounge (huge!) and had a nice shower and freshened up for the domestic leg. For domestic sector they use the A330 but the seat is still comfortable food and service decent. Return leg is more or less the same story fabulous crew on all legs friendly pro-active and lively.

Qantas Airways customer review,So if you want to know what it would be like flying long haul on Ryanair just book Qantas! Now to be fair Ryanair do at least advertise themselves as a budget airline and the prices are cheap to reflect that. Qantas on the other hand are not! As a national carrier they should be ashamed of themselves - but to codeshare with the likes of Emirates is nothing short of farcical in this day and age. They are simply a world apart and do not deserve a 4-star rating. There were times past when BA were pretty abysmal but sadly Qantas have managed to take that a step further. So we booked Economy seats but spent an extra £100 each to get extra legroom by the exits. By the exits also means by the toilets so we suffered the inconvenience of people treading on our toes as they used the area to queue and perform their inflight stretching. But that is nothing really to moan about. What was really unacceptable was the general nonchalant and uncaring attitude of the staff - who freely admitted to being new to the long haul. It was New Years Eve and one might have thought that being Australian was a good enough reason to celebrate the occasion as we flew across the various timezones on our Melbourne-Dubai-London flight. But no - Qantas managed to sidestep that and the thought that just a few of the passengers might appreciate a small bottle of bubbly to see in the New Year. Fat chance! About half an hour into the flight we were offered their 'Welcome drink'. A scratched plastic jug was waved in front of us containing some lemon and elderflower cordial. The dinner service followed about an hour later (about 2am Melbourne time) - though I wondered why? The food was actually pretty good - so no complaint there. But the general lack of attendance by cabin crew was appalling. Friends had warned me not to book Qantas - and it really would be my last resort from now. Anyone heaping praise on them in their review clearly expects vary little in the way of customer service. It begs the question what airline they normally fly on.

Qantas Airways customer review,QF511 BNE-SYD on a Boeing 737-800. What an enjoyable flight!

The FA's were professional and friendly giving us extra bottles of water upon our request. Really cannot fault the service on board. Breakfast was simple - just muesli milk and apple slices adequate for such a short flight. Only negative was that my headphones snapped after opening the packet but this was easily forgiven when the lovely FA promptly fetched me a new one.

Qantas Airways customer review,Four QF sectors over Christmas/New Year AKL-MEL MEL-PER PER-SYD SYD-HNL. On all sectors the food and wine offerings were excellent although on our SYD-HNL flight the dinner service at three hours took far too long. First Lounge in SYD was chaotic but always is around the holidays. Cabin Crew service varied from outstanding to surly.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flight was London Heathrow (LHR) to Sydney (SYD) on the A380 both ways. I have to say this was one of the most comfortable long haul trips I've ever had to Australia. I think the economy seats on the A380 are as good if not better than anything that has been offered in economy before. I thought the staff were very good overall although a couple of flight attendants were not very friendly. The food is now largely served without trays which is fine by me. I thought that the food was mostly good especially the chicken salads offered on several legs. However I was a bit annoyed to miss some of the food which was delivered while most people were sleeping. I think they should perhaps deliver some of these things while more people are awake. I ordered the meal in advance on my Sydney to Dubai leg and this was a bit ordinary but overall I thought the food was decent. My main gripe with the service is that they no longer offer a complimentary toothbrush on this (very) long haul flight. I think it is a bit mean to deprive people of something with which to clean their teeth on effectively a 24 hour journey and I hope they reintroduce this again at least for this very long haul flight.,0,8,G Wayling,2015-01-14,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-MEL A333 and BNE-PER A332. I love flying Qantas and they never disappoint me. First flight was a short one of approx. 1 hour and still the magnificent crew managed to provide with a light meal soft drinks and good smiles. Departed and landed on time. Second flight was a long one from Brisbane to Perth on an old Airbus 330-200 domestic configuration. Again the crew was great they couldn't do more to assist us food very good great variety of drinks. The only negative comment was that we didn't have IFE however the day before the departure I received an email from Qantas apologising and providing extra frequent flyer points for future use.

Qantas Airways customer review,A380 London - Dubai Melbourne to London via Dubai. Paid A$90 for exit row seat on each leg which I think is reasonable and definitely worth it for extreme long haul. Although I chose row 79 which fronts a main galley and is very noisy I'd avoid this row in future. Food was the real surprise - Qantas have done away with all the dinner accessories (biscuits salad cheese chocolate etc) and instead serve much bigger main portions and they were actually amazing very impressed. IFE also very good. Around 100 Oscar winning movies going back to 1970 plus recent releases and full series of TV shows which is great.

Qantas Airways customer review,Travelled Auckland to Brisbane 5th January 2015. Have never been a fan of this over-rated airline therefore I should have known better however decided to give them a go after getting a sale fare. Positives - smooth check in good customer service manager on board and ok food. Negatives - tacky lounge in Auckland service operated by Qantas subsidiary Jetconnect who operate a handful of 737-800s across the Tasman narrow body aircraft that have a premium cabin masquerading as a business class cabin seats that could best be described as premium economy crew who refuse to serve you 40 minutes before arrival because 'we are about to land' dreadful inflight entertainment on tiny screens with old movies old TV shows and old music.

Qantas Airways customer review,Paris-Dubai on Emirates then Qantas from Dubai to Melbourne. We were simply amazed at how wonderful the Emirates experience was. The Economy class cabin was very well staffed the cabin crew were impeccably dressed and couldn't have been more attentive. We were offered drinks early in the flight and they even had a brandy on offer! On the six hour flight we were asked twice more if we would like another drink. The meal was good for Economy and we got little extras offered like an ice cream. On the Qantas QF10 flight Dubai-Melbourne we had paid the extra for the exit row seats in economy but to our horror we were seated in 48 B and C so were adjacent to the cabin crew's work areas and kitchens. Note to self- don't book these seats again on an A380! While the Qantas cabin crew were very friendly but we were not asked if we would like a drink of any kind until quite a way into the flight and then it was a small glass of cordial out of a jug. Then we were given a beef wrap (not bad) in a box (no tray) which was the last I saw of any service until two hours from Melbourne when I was offered a banana. Mind you I was sleeping for a lot of the flight so it's unfair to criticise as I didn't really need service but what would I have got had I been awake I wonder? The meal offered at the end of the flight looked very poor and I opted for cheese and biscuits. Sadly we concluded that we wouldn't fly Qantas again on a long haul flight if we could get an Emirates option at the same time. Compared to Emirates it would seem that everything about the inflight service on Qantas flights needs a big shake up. Our national airline looks and feels tired and will struggle to compete with the Middle Eastern airlines for much longer.,0,4,Lacey Heather,2015-01-05,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,1,N/A,2,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF 97 3 Dec 2014 and return QF 128 15th Dec. I have flown many airlines internationally and Qantas doesn't even come close. Poor level of comfort in business on the A380. Emirates business is first class compared to Qantas business. The meal (dinner) was ok pretty basic but after 2 hours in the Hong Kong business lounge I wasn't overly hungry. The service was poor. Not a lot of attention given to individual passengers. Awoken a full 2.25 hours prior to landing for the worst breakfast I have ever had. Filling out a breakfast order form ala room service is just an aid for the staff to get it over as quickly as possible in the morning. No other airline requires this just poor class. I was looking forward to the relaxing flight home in the flagship plane. Never again for me. No wonder the National Carrier is in trouble financially. 4 of us going to Europe in June yes with Emirates even though Qantas are now sharing the route. Be worth paying much more to go another airline even if Qantas are more expensive. Service with a smile..yes but not much service though unfortunately and definitely a cheaper all-round experience.,0,1,Heathcote Robert,2015-01-05,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,1,N/A,1,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Sydney-Dallas LAX-Sydney. A380 PE window seat across inside aisle back. All up a really good product and will definitely use again. Just a couple of minor quibbles reflecting concerns of others. The foot rest extending from seat is a bit of a waste of time. I am only 165cms and it was too short for even me. Also the seat recline perhaps goes back too far making access from window seat tricky resulting in a bit of arm rest gymnastics. I had no trouble with IFE or meal table with seat in front fully reclined as reported by others though. The meals were fresh and tasty close enough to business class quality. PE now shares washrooms with business on upper deck. Thought the queues would be bad but not the case after all. All up though it was the warm friendly understated service from Qantas staff that was the highlight. An 'upgrade' to business class for last hour of flight into Dallas so as to exit plane quickly for tight connecting flight was a nice touch.,0,8,Andrew Jane,2015-01-05,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,5,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,BNE to LAX in December last year in business. We flew on one of the refurbished 747s on the upper deck and it was fantastic. The upper deck is definitely the place to be. I had expected to feel claustrophobic but it was surprisingly spacious. There were storage pockets everywhere the cabin was spotless and the flight attendants were relaxed friendly and very attentive. I didn't manage to get any sleep (never do on planes) but enjoyed the flight nevertheless and arrived feeling relaxed. The espresso coffee was excellent. For the return - the new lounge in LAX was bigger than I'd expected after hearing all the talk about it being cramped. We were one of the last flights out for the night but there were still plenty of comfortable seats available and the food was good. The lasagne in particular was wonderful.,0,8,R Hollows,2015-01-05,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Its been a very long time since I flew QF internationally. Currently based in Singapore I've been travelling SQ mostly but a recent trip to London then down to Sydney then back up to Singapore I found the best pricing to be on QF business class. The A380 flight from London to Dubai was reasonably OK but only just. The A380 business class was very disappointing. The food and service was great but the seat and comfort was extremely average. I connected to Sydney in Dubai on an Emirates flight (QF flight number). Why would anyone fly Qantas on the same leg? When you are paying $8K+ for your airline ticket Qantas just doesn't cut it. The difference between Qantas and Emirates was extreme. Emirates was probably the best business class I've travelled on. Service and food was exemplary (despite the noisy Australia soccer team being on the same flight). But unfortunately it got more disappointing when I got on the A330 flight from Sydney up to Singapore. This just doesn't compare with any of the major airlines business class. It's simply not worth the cost at all. I was very disappointed but I will say the crew were great and the food better than Singapore Airlines. Qantas really have been left behind. I may get on another international flight but It would be my 4th or 5th choice and I would only do it if it was my only choice. Why people would pay the same price and fly Qantas when there is so much more to offer on other airlines is beyond me.,0,6,N Kiss,2015-01-05,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,4,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Travelled business class from Sydney to Darwin. Cramped and uncomfortable in biz. Light dimmed for sleeping but light from galley glared into passengers faces all night. Staff never tried to pull galley curtain and QF have removed the aisle curtain in their minimalist obsession.

Qantas Airways customer review,My husband and I had not travelled on Qantas for a few years despite travelling to UK every year due to previous bad experiences with them. This year we thought we would give the airline another chance. Boy were we sorry. Miserable staff food appalling headsets didn't work. When you can chose multiple airlines to travel overseas from Australia you would think they would at least try to offer a good service.

Qantas Airways customer review,Decided to try Qantas for the first time on an International flight to Dubai on QF 9 & 10. Short answer - sub standard. Flown on Singapore Malaysian and Emirates over the last few years and Qantas is way behind the competition in terms of efficiency service and comfort. From check in were we were told that that we had exit row seats which turned out to be incorrect a 45min delay slow service both getting meals out and in particular clearing plates and you cannot get a scotch whiskey or a brandy and dry? Our baby bassinet looked more like a solitary confinement gaol cell when compared to other airlines and our young one wouldn't sleep in it due to in being very claustrophobic.

Qantas Airways customer review,Melbourne-Perth-Melbourne A330-200 services. Two excellent and faultless journeys. The crew were really friendly and a delight to be around. I noticed that the food is getting much better. The thai beef with noodles and my Texas BBQ Beef on the return journey was tasty and very fresh.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flight from Melbourne to Brisbane on old 737. Started in Qantas Club whereby food was good but kids section is in need of a very urgent refurbishment. Flight departed on time staff were all friendly and professional food was a hot meal and was an improved offering compared to recent pas. More taste and more of it. Arrived slightly early and bags were ready by the time we got to there. The down side to Qantas is the variation in the 737 fleet and we coped an old one with no personal TV which in 2014 is just not good enough.,0,8,W Burchell,2014-12-31,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,"Flew Business Class Singapore to Melbourne on 10 December leaving at 8.30pm and were less than impressed with Qantas. The staff were excellent but the ""meal"" if you could call it that was truly appalling. We could choose from about 5 dishes no entrees no salads to go with it. I had a chicken patty in a bun that was it part from being offered a slice of bread. My partner chose a duck stew type of dish which was small and not very tasty. Dessert included a choice of cheese a couple of others and a tub of ice cream! And this was supposed to be the much lauded Neil Perry food. Clearly part of the various economy measures from Mr Joyce along with the disappearing QFF points inability to use the Gold membership in the priority boarding queues etc. We paid a lot of money for our tickets and won't do so again. In contrast we flew to Singapore on Emirates which was a delight in every way from the service aircraft entertainment and food. Qantas entertainment was very limited with only a few movies and quite old TV series. After being a Qantas FF since the late 80s I will be moving to Emirates as soon as my membership runs out.",0,3,S Brennan,2014-12-22,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,4,1,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Both my husband and I fly 2 domestic Qantas flights each week for work in Sydney I can honestly say that in the last 6 weeks at least not one flight has run to time. Last week my husbands Monday morning flight was delayed 3 hours they don't notify you of delays which is very inconvenient. Yesterday my flight did three circles over Cessnock before heading to Sydney landing us nearly an hour over time. I think Alan Joyce should take up hotel management as that is where his head is and let someone who is concerned about getting people to where they need to go in a timely fashion and maintaining the services at the airport not worrying about the Qantas lounges there are too many staff doing nothing and the inflight staff are well past their expiry date. When you do one or two flights a year its not concerning but travelling 50 weeks a year it gets a bit up your nose.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew Darwin to Brisbane on 767-300 an aircraft used a long time on this route and about to be retired in a couple of weeks. Plane while refurbished was showing its age however still very comfortable in exit row seat. Lunch served on this flight chicken and macaroni while tasty tired looking with the usual bread roll and chocolate bar. If Qantas continues to promote itself as a premier carrier might be an idea to reintroduce a new meal range for its domestic sector. Service was very good on this flight great crew who were pleasant and efficient even scored a free wine. Ice-cream served later.

Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-Santiago (SCL)-SYD in Premium Economy. I can only echo other's previous comments on the superb nature of Premium Economy on Qantas' long haul services. My very recent return to SCL could not be faulted especially the incredibly professional cabin service and obvious professionalism of the flight crew on this flight which could be considered one of the 'great airline journeys of the world' and the fact this flight skirts the Antarctic Ice Shelf. Food wine and seating were excellent but the crew's attention to detail was outstanding. I sense Qantas becoming a world leader again in long-haul international flight standards. I only wish Qantas had Premium Economy in its A330s (as Cathay Pacific does).,0,10,Roger Stone,2014-12-22,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew on QF1/QF2 flight from London to Sydney return in October 2014 on the A380 Business Class. The overall experience was average. Pros - complimentary chauffeur pick up/drop off in London/Sydney flight timings (late departure from London early arrival Sydney and vice versa) good IFE with many options pyjamas provided albeit of a sub-standard quality friendly staff albeit service offering strange. Cons - not all seats have direct aisle access the food/beverage service/options are absolutely sub-standard. Offered first drink within 30 minutes after take off and then a top up/glass of wine with dinner. That's it. For a 14 hour flight that is pretty shocking. You can stand up and go ask for another drink but I hate having to do that as it feels like asking someone to do me a favour. The entire Business class cabin shares 4 lavatories of which the rear ones are shared with Premium-Eco. The staff are friendly but are limited to the designed service offering. Qantas has a lot to catch up before they will be on par with the likes of Singapore / Cathay.,0,5,John Smith,2014-12-04,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,1,N/A,2,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Melbourne-Sydney and return A330 out and B767 back. The check-in for our outward flight with international connection was smooth and friendly. The flight to Sydney was pleasant apart from the old style seat that offered little back support -- no match for the seat I experienced recently on a Virgin A330. Service and breakfast were good and the plane operated on time. On the return leg there was no business class boarding queue. The seat on the B767 was more comfortable. The service on board was excellent and a tasty early lunch was served. Both lounges were comfortable and offered many options.,0,7,Michael Little,2014-12-01,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways

Great staff A380 Family friendly Best food Kids loved the entertainment onboard Best pilots and even not bad travelling with their partners American Airlines while we were in USA. Missed connecting flight SYD-MEL due to SYD airport being busy but were put on the flight we wanted straight away (more than 6 options given). Only problem with family travelling with kids Qantas and AA would always have the Prams ready for collection at the gate of the aircraft everywhere in the world except in SYD and MEL. No explanation given. Apparently its a special category luggage and have to line up to get with kids waiting for at least 40 minutes.

Qantas Airways customer review,HKG-MEL A330 Business. This is Qantas old business class product with only angled flat beds and a very old IFE system. The seat was quite comfortable in sitting / lounging mode and while the mattress topper made the seat more comfortable in bed mode the angled flat was still not very good for sleeping. The 2-2-2 configuration is also not great as I was in a window seat so getting to the aisle mid-flight in the dark was a bit of a challenge. Food and drink were both excellent and the service provided by the crew was faultless - naturally friendly and professionally efficient. The IFE is not good enough any more with barely any movies on offer and an old poor quality screen to view it on. The Qantas Club lounge in Hong Kong was very nice and not too busy. Overall Qantas do a good job making this old product reasonable however it does not come close to products on offer from competitors. I would recommend Qantas to others but only on their newer aircraft or after the current refit is complete on these aircraft.,0,6,C Down,2014-12-01,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,5,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,I flew Brisbane to Melbourne on a weekday lunchtime flight. I did not expect much in the way of lunch for a 2.5 hour flight but I did expect more than a muffin and an apple and a couple of tea. Flight was full - fair enough but my most abiding impression of the service on the flight was the rudeness and perception of seniority of the female flight attendants who looked after the economy cabin. They were on the older side chatted to each other continually and just shoved out the lunchtime morsels on the dinner round. They simply did not seem to recognise the passengers as being worthy of their attention. To be fair baggage came out reasonably quickly at the other end. I paid $239 for flight and would have expected more than I got. No loss for me I have long ago given up on getting any decent value on the QFF programme - so this flight has made me eager to leave for the other side.,0,4,Peter North,2014-11-25,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,2,N/A,1,3,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,SYD - LAX business class on an old 747-400. Starting with breakfast in the Qantas First Lounge is always a nice way to start a trip. Seated in row 2 I think has some of the best seats on the plane. The IFE did not work properly and when it did there was a very limited selection. Lunch (or dinner) on the flight was adequate I actually can't remember it so it neither impressed nor repulsed. The flight crew were friendly if a little inattentive. Breakfast healthy and a lovely coffee. The seat for an overnight flight was one of the most uncomfortable I've slept on. Especially compared to CX and similar offerings. All in all it's a tired airline well past it's heyday. I fly 80 or so sectors a year and it seems Qantas is struggling to keep up.,0,7,M Ray,2014-11-20,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,4,2,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew on QF42 to Sydney and back to Jakarta on QF41. Most of the crew were nice. A330-300 series back and forth. The interior was ordinary. Personal TV was a joke - pretty small. Cabin crew are now more helpful than 10-15 years ago. Plenty of drinks were served and nice hot chocolate drink was given. I noticed they changed their uniform.

Qantas Airways customer review,Brisbane to Singapore in business class on our way to Europe and the service was fantastic. There weren't many passengers in business but the crew service and food and beverages were excellent. They put a mattress cover on the seat before you go to sleep and a lovely quilt for sleeping. Seat had massage function which was lovely - Entertainment system was great. I have now been spoilt for life it would be difficult to ever fly economy on long haul travel again. We booked these flights with FF points so can't really comment on value for money but the points were definitely worth the comfort and service without doubt.

Qantas Airways customer review,We recently returned from a holiday in South Africa. We flew Qantas on QF63 returning on QF64. Prior to travelling I tracked every flight to see what type of aircraft and what configuration we would be likely to get. Knowing that the run is 100% 747s I documented the age Registration number and name of the aircraft used for 96 flights. During October you were more likely to be flying in one of their oldest planes average age 23 years. 57% of flights which meant that if you were unlucky you got one of these and as we were flying Business class the cabins were still angle flat beds. As I have a bad back I really wanted a full flat bed and you guessed it we got an old plane. Coming home on November 4th we got lucky and were on a younger aircraft with the A380 configuration and full flat beds. We were up in the bubble both ways. The older aircraft have 24 up top the younger models just 18. A big difference with space a bit tight on the older 747's. Since Qantas switched the Sydney Dallas run to A380's the pendulum has swung and you are now more likely to get a newer 747 with re fitted cabins. Aircraft - 5 out of every 7 flights now being the lay flat A380 cabin layout. If you are in the bubble be warned the newer planes have just one toilet upstairs in Business where the older 747's have 2.,0,8,Walter Jennings,2014-11-11,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,My husband and I had the best experience flying on the brand new A380 from Sydney to Dallas on October 2nd 2014. It was quiet and very spacious. We caught 10 flights in 5 weeks all business class (as we are both middle aged) and even our return flight on the Qantas 747 from Tokyo was great too. All our flights with other airlines were really very good but the Qantas planes and the Qantas staff shone the brightest. All meals were excellent. We also loved being able to sit in the bar and chat with fellow passengers in the A380.,0,10,Catherine Shaw,2014-11-11,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Travelled from Dubai to Sydney on A380 and were very disappointed in the food on this flight. We had travelled on the A380 a few years ago and the food was excellent so was expecting similar. We boarded and were served lunch within an hour which was average but then no more meals until 8oclock at night when we were given a packet of crisps and on a 14 hour flight found this very disappointing. We travelled back with Emirates as they on a code share and the food was really good. We had several internal flights with Qantas and the sandwich or pizza snack was lovely so we were surprised at the quantity on the long haul flight. We really like Qantas but was a little disappointed on this occasion. All flights however were on time and comfortable.,0,7,T Redford,2014-11-11,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,2,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,A380 Dallas Fort Worth to Sydney - over 16 hours in the air. Lots of room in a quiet business cabin. Disappointed that the 9pm flight did not have a dinner service but a 'supper' provided. No pre-dining drink service. Large wine list in the magazine but as others have noted - phantoms - with only 2 choices of red or white offered. Service was not at the level of other business class products on our around the world trip. The male steward was the busiest refilling water bottles throughout the flight. Overnight snacks were poor and not replenished. Stewards fitted seat padding and sleep was possible. I found the seat less comfortable than Swiss Business but partner disagreed so personal preference? Would recommend for cabin but don't expect anything else special for your money.,0,7,O Elizabeth,2014-11-06,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,3,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,MEL-SIN QF35 on 15/10. Plenty of spare seats on daytime flight so easy to find extra legroom. Cabin crew very friendly and attentive which was a surprise given past QF experiences. The A330 seats are comfortable compared to the older 747s. Meals average at best. On time departure from MEL and early arrival into SIN. IFE ok and easy to use. Return flight QF 36 on 21/10 was a much less enjoyable experience. Full flight cabin crew took almost an hour to begin meal service (as is often the case on QF overnight flights) and then hurriedly dispensed meal trays. Cabin crew seemed rushed throughout though not unfriendly. Food of similar standard to outbound flight.

Qantas Airways customer review,Once again I was let down by Qantas. The 3.00 flight from CBR-SYD was cancelled. No information was given to passengers until well after the scheduled departure time. When I asked why we hadn't been advised earlier I was advised that they were trying to rearrange schedules for everybody. Conveniently this was only advised after it was too late to transfer the 6 passengers going to Coolangatta to a Virgin flight that left at 3.20. The post script is the flight transferred to was 40 minutes late leaving. End result a 2.5 hour delay in getting to the destination.

Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-LAX on QF11 18 July 2014. Booked chauffeur transfer to SYD which was cancelled by Qantas a couple of weeks before flight because competitors on this route do not offer this service. Complained and the service was reinstated for us. Splendid late breakfast in Qantas Club lounge at SYD. Usual late departure but landed just about on time. Ground crew and cabin crew service was fine. Great service of lovely meals. Departure is early afternoon (13:30+/-) so it is a bit strange to find the cabin lights turned off and blinds down at 18:00. Eventually went to bed and had a good 6 hours sleep.

I have to say as much complaints you can have about Qantas I actually found their inflight service comparable if not better than most Asian Carriers. The flight attendants onboard were New Zealanders and their service was top notched! They offered a few rounds of drinks to all passengers and even remembered requested drinks. I normally will hesitate to fly with Qantas especially with their inflexible rules with ticketing however I feel the need to support our national carrier. Nevertheless I had a great experience with them having flown twice this year and if their ticketing and contact center can improve it will be a bonus to all.,0,7,Darren Chew,2014-11-03,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways

In future a pre-flight snack or taking food on the flight might be a better option. Cabin crew were pleasant on all four sectors and an added bonus was the allocation of exit row seats on the return journey. Qantaslink causes a few anxious moments with their delays (HBA-MEL-HBA) but are good with informing passengers.

Qantas Airways customer review,I agree with the problem with the seat recline in Prem Economy although I do not think they need to reduce the incline but remove a row to give more room to the seats behind. I had an aisle seat but even then found it difficult to get out of my seat when the passenger in front was fully reclined. My fellow passenger in the window seat really struggled to get out. (This could be a safety issue too). I flew the same route same class and Qantas A380 four years ago and feel that they have reduced the spacing between rows since then. My trip this time was 40% more expensive too. Otherwise staff were great food was lovely and everything else OK.,0,7,O Weighell,2014-10-22,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,5,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew LHR to MEL 28 September 2014. On time both sectors. Agree with comments that Premium Economy seats should not recline as far as they do. Had seat in front in my lap the whole journey which apart from inconvenience at meals also meant entertainment screen could not be viewed properly. The fussy tablecloths should be deleted and perhaps replaced by better food and tray. Extra legroom well worth it. Staff were active around mealtimes but rarely seen during long night sectors.

Qantas Airways customer review,Darwin to Adelaide. Upgraded to Business using points for this Saturday afternoon flight. The attention and service is very nice bigger seats and plenty of legroom but I feel somewhat let down by the catering. It's very nice to have a gin and tonic for a pre lunch drink but do I need the pretzels they also serve in economy. There were only two mains offered a hot and cold option hot being duck which I don't eat and the cold being couscous. The meal was nice enough but expect a bit more for Business Class. A warm bread roll and small bowl of fruit made up the meal and later Maggie Beer ice cream. A beautiful Riesling was served throughout the meal while partner opted for red and assured me that both were extremely good labels. While the overall experience is very nice I would like that little bit extra in Business food wise that distinguishes it from Economy. Perhaps because the economy product is generally very good is the problem - after all you get cheese and crackers on some flights a hot meal and ice cream too. Overall enjoyable experience.,0,8,Paul Williss,2014-10-13,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways

Seat turns in a bed and I managed to sleep 6 1/2 hours on my way back from LAX. Not so fortunate on my way to LAX but crew kept me happy with good quality snacks and drinks during the entire flight. Did not use lounge in BNE as I am not overly impressed by this lounge. New lounge in LAX very nice but too small to handle all passengers departing on various QF flights in the evening. Will hopefully get better once the new first class lounge opens end of the year. I will continue to support Qantas and will make them my first choice as long as the air fare is competitive.,0,9,P Schweizer,2014-10-13,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Yesterday flew Brisbane to Perth QF580. Plane full of families with children including us with two. No in seat entertainment even though it was a new A330. Seats had slots for iPads but no iPads on board. When someone asked steward explained that it was a new plane that was waiting for fit out which sounds like nonsense to me. No kids pack (same on the way over). We travel frequently with kids. The last time was July and this is the first time no kids pack has been offered. Must be something else QF has decided to cut costs on. Food was average at best. My wife and I commented how the food service had deteriorated over the past 10 years. No care or attention from the predominately male crew. Flight 20 mins late. Bags available quickly which was good. Have been a long time loyal customer of Qantas mainly due to FF but seriously considering other carriers for our next OS journey.,0,3,P Corbett,2014-10-13,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,1,N/A,1,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Travelled QF9 LHR-DXB on August 22nd. Had pre-booked at a cost of 25AUD per person to allocate seats 75D and 75E. Checked in with no problems but at boarding gate were advised our seats had been re-allocated. We made the point that we had actually pre-booked and paid for the seat allocation and were a bit put out that we had been selected to be moved when in all probability there were other passengers on the flight who had not gone to the trouble of pre-booking seats. Apparently a family wished to be accommodated together. The clerk at the counter gave us our new boarding passes row 88. We said we were happy as long as they were not next to the toilets. We don't make a habit of sitting near toilets in restaurants or airplanes hence the reason we paid the money to pre-book allocation. The clerk checked on his monitor and categorically assured us they were not next to toilets. Having boarded the aircraft we realized we were duped. Row 88 is the farthest row back and is sandwiched between two toilets. Furthermore the seats have limited recline. They are also immediately in front of a bulkhead behind which is situated some form of noisy refrigeration unit for the self service galley area immediately behind us. We were not provided with equivalent seats for which we had paid. More to the point they were arguably the worst seats on the plane. The constant noise from the flushing toilets and refrigeration unit made it impossible to intelligibly listen to any IFE. My partner was very upset at the reallocated seats and credit to the cabin crew they were sympathetic towards our situation and indeed was not their fault. Whilst on the flight we walked through the cabin to check out our pre-booked seats. By no means was it a family with young children in our seats. Be warned about paying for pre-booked seats on Qantas.,0,1,K Squire,2014-10-13,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,4,N/A,5,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Sept 1st Economy on QF10 LHR-MEL via Dubai on a A380. We did get a seat on the upper deck and all in all were more than happy with the flight. Cabin crew were professional and yet were ready for a laugh too which always makes for a more enjoyable trip. Seating was a comfortable as one would expect when not flying further up the aircraft but the service inflight entertainment (love the touch screen) and drinks service were all excellent. Now for the food. I have done this trip about 18 times over the years and honestly had the two best hot meals ever on any airline on this flight. Fish pie on the LHR to Dubai leg which was delicious and the Ricotta and mushroom ravioli. Normally would never touch the bread roll but used it to mop up every little bit of sauce on both dishes. Evidently Qantas are trialing a new menu and big thumbs up to that.,0,10,Nyall Greene,2014-10-13,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew LHR to MEL 28 September 2014. On time both sectors. Agree with comments that Premium Economy seats should not recline as far as they do. Had seat in front in my lap the whole journey which apart from inconvenience at meals also meant entertainment screen could not be viewed properly. The fussy tablecloths should be deleted and perhaps replaced by better food and tray. Extra legroom well worth it. Staff were active around mealtimes but rarely seen during long night sectors.

Qantas Airways customer review,Darwin to Adelaide. Upgraded to Business using points for this Saturday afternoon flight. The attention and service is very nice bigger seats and plenty of legroom but I feel somewhat let down by the catering. It's very nice to have a gin and tonic for a pre lunch drink but do I need the pretzels they also serve in economy. There were only two mains offered a hot and cold option hot being duck which I don't eat and the cold being couscous. The meal was nice enough but expect a bit more for Business Class. A warm bread roll and small bowl of fruit made up the meal and later Maggie Beer ice cream. A beautiful Riesling was served throughout the meal while partner opted for red and assured me that both were extremely good labels. While the overall experience is very nice I would like that little bit extra in Business food wise that distinguishes it from Economy. Perhaps because the economy product is generally very good is the problem - after all you get cheese and crackers on some flights a hot meal and ice cream too. Overall enjoyable experience.,0,8,Paul Williss,2014-10-13,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,"Short commuter flight from regional area to Brisbane FAs very professional and well presented pleasant and helpful. Although on the hour flight there wasn't any inflight VOD the FAs chatted and interacted beautifully with pax and made the trip fun on a flight with school aged kids on a trip to the ""big smoke"". Flight was on time both going and return. Gate at Brisbane airport less than inspiring but worked for the aircraft. Beverage and snack provided both a pleasant surprise and great opportunity to display artisan Australian foods.

Qantas Airways customer review,I flew with Qantas at the end of Sept 2014 from LHR to DXB in economy. Seat was ok with some extra space for legs which is essential for me as I'm tall.

Qantas Airways customer review,I flew with Qantas from DRW-BNE on a 737-838 and was very pleased with every aspect of my journey. The aircraft was fitted with personal seat-back entertainment which contained a number of different entertainment options that kept me occupied during the flight. The crew were their usual bright and bubbly selves yet still professional about their jobs. The in-flight meal was quite good and was served both quickly and politely. During our descent into Brisbane a passenger became rowdy and refused to sit down. The crew handled the situation expertly and efficiently.

Qantas Airways customer review,CBR-PER: Travelled in August 2014. Check-in was straightforward and staff was ready to assist me with the kiosk check-in. This was the only direct flight to Perth from Canberra. Was pleasantly surprised to find the plane was brand new and clean. AVOD had good selection and food was pleasant where alcoholic beverages were served. PER- CBR: The return trip used a different plane. IFE was from the top panel rather than individual AVOD. The interior felt like I was in the vintage 90s but the excellent service of the crew well made up for it. Flight arrived ahead of schedule. A couple of years I avoided Qantas's flights because of previous unpleasant international flight experiences with them but it appears that they have improved their standards substantially for their domestic flights.,0,10,K Kenneth,2014-10-05,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew Premium Economy LAX to SYD. Flight left on time which was nice to have after some disasters on American carriers trying to get to LAX. Both the meals dinner and breakfast were fine as was the in-flight entertainment. The staff on the flight were polite efficient and very pleasant to deal with. My only complaint is the recline in premium economy which in my opinion goes too far back as it makes eating watching movies and getting out of the seat almost impossible for the person behind. In my case the less than considerate passenger seated in front of me decided to go to sleep just before both meals forcing me to eat in a contortionist manner. The very lovely flight attendant looking after me tried on both occasions to assist with no luck.,0,7,M Whiteley,2014-10-05,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,5,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,JFK-LAX-MEL in economy. This trip turned into a nightmare due to an unimaginable 'operations' decision that adversely impacted the travel plans of 50-100 passengers. As background QF runs the JFK-LAX flight for passengers going onwards to Sydney Melbourne and Brisbane. It is a huge convenience as there is no need to change terminals at LAX no need to go through TSA security a second time and generally better to fly QF transcontinental USA than the US carriers except on this night. That said the JFK-LAX flight on this particular evening was running about one hour behind schedule due to late arrival of the aircraft and typical JFK evening delays - this isn't all that unusual and the delay not all that long. For inexplicable reasons however Qantas chose not to hold the LAX-MEL flight for all of the passengers on the JFK-LAX flight who were Melbourne bound. Even with the one hour delay on the domestic leg we still arrived LAX before the scheduled departure time of the overseas leg and the LAX-MEL flight was running 30 minutes behind as well so Qantas had no legitimate reason not to hold the flight for another 30 minutes or so to get all Melbourne passengers on board. This forced all 50-100 of us to fly a packed B747 instead of the more comfortable A380 lost seat assignments and change planes in Sydney which is more complicated than you would think (domestic and international terminals aren't close and there is no easy from one to the other) and even worse added approximately five hours to the trip. It is inexcusable and Qantas has been unapologetic and unresponsive to emails I've written them about their decisions on that evening. It is no wonder that their international business is suffering - on this evening they disrupted the travel plans and offended 50-100 passengers with one very poor decision.,0,1,J Rose,2014-10-05,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,3,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,"I found four things seriously wrong with Qantas First Class. 1) The ""Chauffeur Drive"" service. Arriving in Sydney at 6.30am having booked a car I was surprised to be told (after finally locating the tiny unmarked desk) that there was a 15-20 minute wait until a car was available. Why? How? A car was booked. It should have been there end of story. Also in the car before my the previous flight (Sydney-London) I was delighted to receive an expletive-laden tirade across the driver's radio - apparently from one of his colleagues having a bad day. That is not ""first class"". 2) Baggage. Qantas advertises that First Class bags will be ""among the first"" to be delivered off the plane. On arrival in Sydney mine were among the last (both turning up on the carousel a full 50 minutes after landing; I do not remember the timing in London). 3) The breakfast. Scrambled eggs were dry. Avocado was unripe. Pancakes were also dry and overcooked. Coffee was weak and burnt. That is all. 4) The champagne. Qantas advertises three varieties. On every leg of the Sydney-London return trip the only one available was the Taittinger blanc de blancs. Methinks these are phantoms included in the wine list solely for appearances.",0,1,A Brown,2014-10-01,no,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,3,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Recently travelled SYD - Cairns direct and Cairns-Brisbane-Sydney return. Very disappointed on all flights. The food was some of the worst I have had on any flight for a number of years. With three meals in all the most I was able to stomach at each sitting was one mouth full. Entertainment on the Sydney - Cairns leg was a supplied ipad unit which didn't work. The Cairns - Brisbane leg seemed to be a newer plane with inseat screens which worked well and the final Brisbane-Sydney leg had nothing.

Qantas Airways customer review,An eight hour wait at Changi airport I assume because it's more important to Qantas to fill their plane to capacity than it is to schedule enough services to avoid excessive waiting times. The inflight service was awful. I'm a vegetarian so get meals served before other passengers and I can only assume this is a crime on Qantas flights. On Flight QF52 from Changi on Saturday 20/09/2014 I got my meal slapped in front of me about an hour into the flight and then the tray sat there for around two hours whilst everyone else was served and their trays collected. I would guess I was probably the last passenger to have their tray taken away. By the time one of the stewardesses took the tray I had back pain and was cramped from being trapped in one position for so long. Likewise I got my breakfast shoved at me before everyone else too and what a breakfast - a stale croissant and a sachet of awful tasting marmalade. I was given only a spoon with which to slice my stale croissant and spread the marmalade and when I requested a knife and a sachet of butter I was grudgingly given the knife but butter was obviously out of the question. Personally I think passengers seated near babies should be given a decent discount because it's simply unfair to be forced to spend long flights being prevented from sleep by crying babies. I first flew with Qantas about 10 years ago and swore never again back then but my travel agent talked me into giving them another go.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew from Singapore to Sydney. There was no reason why the plane left late as it was sitting at the gate four hours before departure. The plane left 30 minutes late and by the time we got to Sydney it was put into a holding pattern because it was late. By the time it landed it was nearly an hour late. Because of this we and many others missed connecting flights. Qantas on time performance is a joke. They got us to Singapore an hour late and nearly matched it on the way back. Going through customs we explained the situation to the officer and he said most Qantas planes were late. If you need a connecting flight steer well clear of Qantas as you will miss it.

Personal greetings and introductions nothing too much trouble. Food and beverages excellent. Lounges excellent especially in Perth.

Qantas Airways customer review,Due to fly QF8006 Business to BNE via Dubai. No airline communication but Chauffeur rang to ask us if we knew anything about flight being cancelled. No. Rang Qantas who knew nothing and then Emirates who knew less (Codeshare). Eventually transpires mechanical problem with Airbus delay at least until 11.45 am (departure due 22.15 today). We need to get to BNE so suggest less attractive flight available (with seats and originally lower cost) from BHX or MAN. QF say Emirates unwilling to reroute us Emirates say unable to alter as only QF have the ability to do this! An hour spent on telephone to all corners of the globe and finally both QF and EK agreed they need to do something and we should wait. Number given for direct contact. No call from either airline but chauffeur rings us to ask if we know what is happening (No) and arranges to pick us up at 4.30 am to get to Heathrow. So arrive at least 13 hours late in Dubai means we miss connecting BNE flight (only one per day) and arrive at best 24 hours later than planned. An extra 24 hours travelling.

Qantas Airways customer review,QF98 Hong Kong to Brisbane (Overnight Flight). This flight left around 20 minutes later than it should due to airport issues. Captain kept everyone fully informed which was good. Flight crew provided prompt and excellent service which given it was an overnight flight was very good. Meal served after 40 minutes in the air giving passengers around 7 hours sleep. Aircraft was only half full so pretty much everyone had a spare seat next to them so they could stretch out a bit. I managed to get around 6 hours sleep in which is pretty good for me in economy as I'm tall (having the extra space really helped). Food was very good although the breakfast pastry was bland. IFE was totally pathetic IFE Screen only 10cm in size and the current selection of movies and music was simply appalling. You get much better IFE on domestic flights so lift your game Qantas. Aircraft seat got pretty hard after 9 hours flying and the aircraft is looking old needs to be revamped shortly. We all got through Brisbane Immigration quite quickly only to be held up for ages waiting for baggage to come through this is another area that needs improving upon in Brisbane.,0,7,Craig Ritchie,2014-09-19,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,I've been a Qantas frequent flyer for a number of years now and fly with them domestic for the most part. For international flights I avoid them like the plague as they are expensive and the service is sub par. This particular flight was BKK-SYD and I was just relieved I was able to secure an aisle seat (with the added bonus of the spot next to me being unoccupied). Online check in was not available for this flight for some mysterious reason. The cabin crew need a lesson in grooming and customer service ASAP. All of them looked bored and somewhat angry. The service as usual was disinterested and disconnected. Breakfast was just thrown at the passengers. One of the ladies looked like she just rolled out of bed and one of the male attendants needs to shave so as one doesn't look like they've been awake for 24 hours. The food service was mediocre (as usual). Most notable was their 'breakfast' which was a small muffin yoghurt and orange juice. Please note that in their domestic flights (ie SYD-MEL) this is almost the same amount of food that's served. In a 9 hour flight with a 4 hour gap between the dinner and breakfast service one is left rather starving.,0,6,A Joven,2014-09-19,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,2,4,Qantas Airways

The seating was no better than Economy class only a few rows behind us. Difference being we paid over $7500 for our seats and Economy would have been under $1000 for the same trip. The plane was an A330-200 and had recently been changed from Jetstar (budget airline) according to a steward on board.

Qantas Airways customer review,This is a very short flight scheduled time 55 minutes but in practice it's more like 30 minutes so one would expect things to go smoothly. And smoothly go it did. I checked in online on my phone no paper needed had no baggage so it was more like catching a bus than a plane. Literally walked through security had a drink and onto the plane. Everything was on time and worked like clockwork. On that 30 minute flight they managed to serve everyone (about 100+ passengers) with a delicious sandwich and beverage of choice; mine a glass of wine - included in the fare.

Qantas Airways customer review,Sydney-Dallas QF007 on September 5 2014. Paying a premium for QF Premium Economy and looking at their website - I must say I was expecting something exceptional. This was not the case. 747-400 Seat 36K is said to be one of the best seats but if you are 6ft+ then this is not the case. The wall in front means you actually have less leg room than standard economy. The cabin was 100% full and the single toilet was used consistently especially by QF staff as their rest area was adjacent to it. Meals etc were quite good however it seemed economy passengers were offered ice cream/chocolates etc mid flight - but we were not (minor issue I know but at double the price I expected more). Was never offered a drink (except at meal times). An exit seat in economy would have saved me $2000 and been of better value I feel.,0,6,D Nelson,2014-09-14,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,3,3,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew Business Class on 20th August Sydney to Manila. I haven't flown Qantas long haul for some time and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. The inflight service from the cabin crew was outstanding. From the service manager down nothing was too much trouble and everything was done with a smile. The drink service and the meals were first class. The meals were of exceptional quality. Seating was comfortable and soon will be even better with the A330 being upgraded to lie flat seats. Communication from the flight deck was very good and certainly portrays a very comfortable and secure feeling to passengers. Well done Qantas I will certainly fly with them again.,0,10,Alan Woolf,2014-09-10,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew MEL to PER 1/09/14. Had some concerns pre-flight because my mother is recovering from a major back operation. Could not have asked for better service. From check-in at Melbourne to bag collection at Perth the quality of service was exceptional. Especially the flight staff who paid my mother the utmost attention did everything possible to relieve her anxieties about flying and made the trip as pleasant for her as possible. The seats were comfortable enough although a little more shoulder room would have been appreciated. The person next to me took the liberty o spreading out as much as he could and took up not only the left side armrest but also the one between us leaving me with sitting in as cramped a position as possible. The food was good - just the right size serving for a mid-range flight of four hours. Ice cream was offered as well which was a nice treat. Inflight entertainment was good and varied. Didn't use it myself but noticed others around me using it. Thanks again to the wonderful flight attendants - they really made the trip a most enjoyable experience.,0,9,N Tilley,2014-09-06,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF52 SIN-BNE 31/8/14 - Singapore lounge was well maintained but busy with the atmosphere of a pub in many parts. Cabin crew were very attentive and helpful and very friendly - Qantas leave other airlines out in the cold when it comes to cabin crew service in business class. Unfortunately the business class seats on this A330 were angled which aren't as easy to sleep on compared to proper lie flat beds. The inflight entertainment on this flight seemed very dated but it was an overnight flight so wasn't a major problem.,0,7,G Penola,2014-09-06,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,We flew Perth to Darwin departure delayed in Perth due to fog so got into Darwin late. Excellent service great breakfast friendly staff fabulous entertainment. We then flew Adelaide to Canberra quick flight. Dinner time was delicious but because of the short flight we didn't get our cup of tea. Canberra to Perth - direct flight great couldn't fault anything except the food. I ordered the red curry and rice and there just wasn't enough. It was so delicious I could have eaten another two or three! I would love the recipe.

Qantas Airways customer review,Melbourne / Perth / Melbourne A330 service on 23 August 2014. Very difficult to find fault. On time departure early arrival in both directions. Aircraft immaculate two meal choices for both breakfast and dinner crew friendly and efficient on near to full flights. Flight over had touch screen video whereas flight back had a slightly older video system with a smaller screen.

Qantas Airways customer review,"I flew Qantas before from NZ to OZ - frequently actually and no issues there but never before long haul - Dubai - Auckland. That's where it started - I booked Qantas - but only the Dubai - Auckland leg was actually operated by Qantas (A380) - must have been the oldest and dare I say it largest crew I had on any international flight ever - however they where friendly and very efficient. The plane was half empty so many people managed to get 3 or 4 seats for themselves (sadly not me) and sleep. The food was great - even for Economy and the selection of inflight movies was ok. The problems started when I had to catch my connecting flight to Auckland - operated by JetStar - and what a difference! Middle of the night flight and no pillow or blanket no seats where one could even attempt to sleep on as they do not have head rests that would keep the head where it is - no food either (unless one pays for it and then it's only sandwiches or crisps) - On my online tickets it says by meals (Qantas) - ""we offer a wide variety of food"" - nothing! The least they could have done is tell their customers. If they do a codeshare that is fine but at least offer the same service.",0,4,R Baker,2014-08-26,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,2,N/A,3,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,"Qantas really needs to lift their game if they want to compete with the other airlines who are miles ahead in almost every way! The trouble started when they tried to charge me around $150 to book our seat numbers - have never heard of international airlines doing that? I regularly travel to USA and have never encountered that. Travelled to Phuket with the kids and shunned Jetstar (who fly direct) and paid extra to fly Qantas via Bangkok. The kids really had their hearts set on in-seat entertainment and games so we decided the extra money wasn't too much and the extra 4 hours it added to the trip wasn't a big deal if it kept them quiet. Well what a mistake that was! Qantas in-flight entertainment was poor on the way over and non-existent on the way home. Said there was a ""Technical Fault"" on the return and apologised at the end but really? The planes are just too old. I tried to watch a movie but the ""buffering"" and jumping made that impossible - I gave up after the 2nd attempt and just went to sleep. Ordered Duty free when the hostess came around approx 40 mins into the trip (6.25pm departure from BKK) and tried my best to stay awake but was woken at 3.30am when she finally arrived with it (but had the order wrong anyway). My daughter opted for the pork for dinner - the hostess had run out and only had chicken and said she'd be straight back with it but forgot - so she was never fed.",0,1,L Munro,2014-08-20,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,3,N/A,1,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,I flew on QF1 Sydney to Heathrow mid July 2014 Business class. This flight was fantastic all aspects were up to Qantas's usual standard including the inflight entertainment choices. Being able to watch the Kerry O'Brien interviews with Paul Keating again was a very pleasant way to pass the time. Food and wine were fantastic and the crew personalised the service by using my name this is a nice touch and not all airlines do this. Qantas has the A380 configured as 2x2x2 which is not as good as the 1x2x1 of Singapore airlines but the mattress topper made a difference and the seat became quite comfy for sleeping.

I flew from LHR to Dubai and must say it was one of the nicer inflight experiences in quite a while. The crew were friendly and warm. The food served was quite nice and were regularly served refreshments and snacks. The leg room was great compared to a few other airlines.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew Brisbane - Hong Kong on August 16. Due to a mix up in online check-in I had been allocated seat 60B nearly the worst seat on the aircraft and impossible to change. At the airport (a 55 minute wait for the 'bag drop') the check-in attendant initially said there was no hope of getting a better seat but eventually managed to find me 27A a window seat in the 'quiet' zone just behind Business. Also an express pass through security. Lunch was served promptly and bottles of water distributed although it was a day flight the window shades were all pulled down. Crew very helpful - endless pot noodles for those who wanted snacks plenty of water and soft drinks passed around and - ice cream. Just before landing was served a very awkward slice of hot pizza - a simple sandwich would have been fine. Overall was just fine.,0,9,A Godfrey,2014-08-20,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew LAX-SYD on Qantas QF12. An extremely enjoyable flight which I can't say I've ever said about a long haul economy flight! I was lucky enough to score a seat in the upper decks small economy section even luckier I had an entire row to myself allowing me to stretch out and even get 5 hours of sleep! The flight had an entire economy section empty on the lower deck so it was a quiet flight. Staff were great very attentive we had 2 flight attendants looking after our section of just 24 guests! The food as always was economy airline food edible but nothing special. The wine however was great the flight attendant was even giving me a Pinot Gris from the premium section as it was open. The IFE was okay the new releases a were quite limited but the Oscar classics as always were a winner! All in all it was a great flight even managed to clear customs in 15 minutes in sydney! If you can score a seat on the upper deck especially one with extra legroom its almost as good as paying the extra $2000 for premium!,0,10,C Feder,2014-08-20,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew on QF2 from Dubai to Sydney in Economy class. I had the option to get on Emirates EK417 too for the same price (departs after an hour QF2 departs) but took QF2 to reduce the transit time at Dubai and in the end regretted my decision. After making the booking Qantas changed the flight time which reduces the gap between the two flights just to 30 minutes. This was not a big issue however simply put the seat pitch and width made it one of the most uncomfortable long haul journey with my wife and two kids. EK417 seat pitch is 32-34 in with 18in width whereas QF2 seats were 17.5in wide with only 31in pitch hard to move in and out very painful with the front seats reclined. Besides that the service was better than Emirates (flew on Emirates Sydney-Dubai on the same trip). Emirates served meals thrice whereas on QF2 it was twice. Emirates had also an edge with onboard wifi. But in the end the seat pitch mattered the most.,0,7,S Hassan,2014-08-20,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Further to my 9 August posting the saga continued. Qantas phoned us on 8th just before we left for Barcelona airport to tell us that our seats were required for a bassinet booking from Dubai to Sydney. When we boarded our flight in Dubai on Friday 8 August there was neither a baby nor a bassinet to be seen. They had simply given our front row seats to two other passengers rather than letting us have our reserved seats back. If this is how the Qantas/Emirates codeshare works I want no part of it. The Purser on the flight was bemused as he told us that they were not expecting any baby or bassinet at 43B and C. Also our flight from Dubai to Sydney was going on to Auckland and the menu for breakfast arriving in Sydney was almost identical to that for the Sydney to Auckland sector just some subtle changes. I have no idea what the Trans-Tasman passengers were actually served as our flight was diverted to Brisbane for fuel when Sydney airport closed due to fog. Our flight arrived in Sydney about 11.00 instead of 06.00. To add insult to injury Qantas could not even get our baggage onto our rebooked flight even though they had six hours to sort it out - not even on the following morning's flight across the ditch.,0,1,Peter Snow,2014-08-15,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,5,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew from Cairns to Melb on a weekday flight which was completely full. The flight was 15 mins late departing but arrived in MEL on time. The crew were friendly and attentive and provided very good service throughout. This looked like a fairly new 737-800 and the quality of the in-flight entertainment and the viewing screen was excellent. As for the meal this was a really pleasant surprise consisting of a nice Moroccan lamb dish followed later by an ice cream. Qantas gets its share of knockers but this flight was certainly up there with the best of any domestic service.,0,9,P Gerner,2014-08-14,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-PER in business class on A330-200. First generation skybed was comfortable for 5 hour flight. Crew promptly met requests but weren't particularly warm. On entering plane CSM was fretting as crew member meant to be at door to plane wasn't there not a good look in front of passengers. Wheels were up at 5.30pm but instead of immediately offering a drink once seat belt sign was up crew did not start serving drinks until 6.30. This isn't good enough for a dinner service in business. Whilst Qantas advertise dining for east-west coast flights as international business selection of dishes a lot less than international flight and not filling which for a dinner flight was a problem and I had to order room service when I arrived in Perth hotel.

Qantas Airways customer review,What a fiasco! The Emirates/Qantas partnership works for some but obviously not for my wife and me. We booked flights in January for a regular trip from Wellington to Barcelona and return and reserved our seats at that time. One day prior to our return we have found that our seat reservation for front row on Emirates economy has been cancelled and we are now halfway back in the aircraft from Dubai to Sydney. Phoned Emirates who said that Qantas had changed them and could easily change them back to the original ones. However Emirates could not change them for us. phoned Qantas from France (the callcentre is in Cape Town and Qantas does not even fly there) to be told that Emirates changed them and that Qantas could not change them back. During the conversation the Qantas service agent even changed my seat from row 61 to row 78 and left my wife in row 61 - goodness only knows why! We are both Silver grade FFs and Qantas Club members but it counts for nothing. I am due to make the fifth trip in 18 months on this route and am about to cancel the next one having only booked it three days ago and paid for my seats. Singapore Airlines has never treated us like this on the same route - Wellington to Barcelona and return.,0,1,Peter Snow,2014-08-08,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,1,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,MEL-DBX 24th July. Having flown the ME carriers between Europe and Aus a few times I opted to fly Qantas this time and. I was pleasantly surprised. The A380 looked nice and provided enough room for this 1.90m tall to feel somewhat comfortable during the long flight. Soon after take off they distributed water bottles which was appreciated as nowadays with the rules on bringing fluids in the plane I tend to forget to get that bottle on the other side of customs. Our hostess was very friendly genuinely interested in the passengers she was serving and smiling even at the end of the very long flight. Plenty to choose from the on board entertainment system and a very smooth flight. I will certainly consider flying Qantas again for the long haul flights.,0,9,I Piet,2014-08-08,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,LON to DXB seat 32G - pleasant surprise flying Qantas operated flight on EK ticket. Small economy section upstairs much better than main Econ cabin - only drawback was FA's passing by with service for prem Econ not offered in Econ and having to constantly ask for things. However once asked staff were responsive. Eg. Staff coming by with trolleys of drinks in glass/plastic for prem Econ and then returning with paper cups for economy passengers! No drinks service before meal service but meal was edible and perfectly acceptable. Snack was warmed up pizza still in cardboard wrapper however overall a better experience than EK on the way back and would definitely choose Qantas in preference to EK in future.,0,7,Susie Rogers,2014-08-06,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,3,4,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew Darwin to Cairns on Boeing 717. Flight leaves Darwin at 8pm getting into Cairns around 11pm. Dinner is served on this flight hot dish with usual bread roll and dessert in form of cookies brownies or scrolls of some type. Alcohol is served after and not during or before meal service which I think is odd. Service is adequate though I find you need to ring for service more and more on Qantas. Food was fine though beef stew was a bit strange. 717 is quite a comfortable plane flight was good though for a two and a half hour flight and no entertainment prices are quite steep. Used Qantas voucher and points though if we had paid would have come close to $800 return each.,0,8,Paul Williss,2014-07-31,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,5,1,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,QF12 LAX-SYD Business class. My expectation was high since it was my first QF business class experience in the Airbus 380. As frequent users of European and Asian airlines it was a quiet experience. It seems fellow passengers knows services and facilities very well but I would appreciate some explanation from staff but none. Their service was absolutely minimum. I had to request each time. My largest problem was the seat. Fully flat but there was a hard part at the back which made me very uncomfortable in sleeping position for which I paid a large sum. With regards to food and beverages I skipped dinner and only had a breakfast. Their continental breakfast was the minimum quantity and quality.

Qantas Airways customer review,AKL-HKG via Sydney on 19th July. This was the first time that we had flown with Qantas for many years. The round trip price was excellent and all sectors of the outwards trip were very good. The SYD-HKG sector on the A380 was excellent. Every aspect of the service was first class and staff were always willing to assist in any possible way. Meals were well presented and quite adequate for the journey. Trays were cleared away at regular intervals and regular water runs made throughout the flight. Nothing was too much trouble for this specific crew on this flight. We look forward to our return flight with them in August.,0,10,Baumberg Gavin,2014-07-27,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew Qantas Sydney to LA on 22nd June 2014. Paid extra for Exit Seats and was not disappointed extra legroom made the 15 hour flight seem less. The FA (Ned) in our area was extremely helpful at all times. Meals were better than we expected. Overall Qantas is by far the best airline we have travelled with and will do so again.,0,8,Chris Dodd,2014-07-27,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF10 for LHR-DXB connecting to EK380 from DXB-HKG. The first flight aboard QF10 was excellent. If you compare the Qantas IFE to the ICE entertainment on Emirates I actually found the Qantas one to be slightly more appealing. This is because there were more recent movies that were actually attracting aboard Qantas whereas for Emirates it is just sheer breadth but the amount of movies that I actually wanted to watch was just a handful. As I have a habit of collecting playing cards from airlines I travel with I found it slightly frustrating that you have to actually have to buy it aboard Qantas whereas you get it for free onboard airlines such as LH CX KA EK SQ AY. Nevertheless the seat pitch comfort and food service were top notch for economy. What stood out the most were the most friendliest cabin crew who did not hesitate to help during any time of the flight. As there was a tight connection I love how the ground staff isolated passengers connecting on EK380 upon disembarkation in Dubai so they could speed us through immigration and transfer.,0,9,Jacob Choi,2014-07-27,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Last leg of a four leg return to Europe with Qantas/Emirates from Dubai to Sydney. My wife and I experienced the best flight service we have had. From the moment we arrived at the door we felt welcome and valued. The crew were friendly without being obsequious efficient without being underfoot and always available. In short nothing was too much trouble. The food was the best I ever had in an airplane and my wife agrees (we had different choices). I have flown many airlines and have yet to experience this quality of service. Although I have always rated Qantas service highly this particular crew rewrote the book on how to treat passengers.,0,10,R Turner,2014-07-20,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew on QF 107 - SYD-LAX-JFK - in premium economy in mid-June. All up a really good experience with really friendly crew plus decent food and wine. It has been a while since I have been on a 747 and I must say that it is a good solid plane. It is louder in-flight than the A380 but it certainly takes off and lands better. The only thing I could fault is the experience at LAX - I got lost transferring here and eventually found my way quite frustrating though. They need to give out an instruction card or have people around directing you where to go. This aspect of it was poorly handled & I am not an inexperienced traveller.

Qantas Airways customer review,I recently flew to LA from Melbourne on an A380 and the entire experience was wonderful. The sale price of the ticket was great and then the flight was even better. Helpful staff excellent and piping hot food as well as heaps of movies and TV shows made the entire flight a joy. I could not recommend them more highly! The only thing that was a little bit annoying was the default radio channel that plays while you select your viewing options was playing hideous old aussie songs which got a bit irritating after 13 hours.,0,10,Sam Cramer,2014-07-17,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Jakarta to Sydney in economy class QF 42 on July 6th 2014 and departed on time. Returning on QF 41 on July 16th 2014 but departed a little bit late due to catering. The PTV screen is pretty small and looks cheap. No amenities (toothbrush sock eyes shades etc) were given to the passengers. I can not even find any of these even in the toilet. The toilet only provides liquid hand soap and sanitary napkins. Fortunately the cabin was clean and crews were polite and courteous. Meals were edible.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew on QF94 from LAX-MEL. The flight was delayed by an hour due to a connecting flight with most of the passengers being late. We pushed back to find there was an issue with a gauge on the aircraft and waited on the tarmac for another hour. The captain and crew kept everyone informed very well. The cabin crew were extremely friendly prompt and professional on the flight. The economy seat is not that comfortable for a 15 hour flight and I found myself walking around a lot more than I should because of that. Food was good for economy as well.

Qantas Airways customer review,I'm putting in a late review for travel Darwin-Sydney and return in early June because I was impressed by their handling of the ash cloud disruptions. Unlike another airline that completely mishandled my bookings Qantas called me regularly rescheduled flights quickly and allowed free changes to connecting flights that I couldn't make because of a problem with a different airline. That's generally the biggest plus about Qantas - their customer service and ground organisation is efficient and problems are generally resolved quickly. Inflight the experience was good with nothing special. Medium-quality food. Service appears to improved drastically compared to a few years ago. Quality individual IFE on the 737 from Darwin-Sydney but the 737 in the opposite direction didn't have individual IFE - which really seems outdated for a 4 hour flight on a major airline.,0,9,D Olsson,2014-07-17,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew Qantas return between Brisbane and Cairns and it was fantastic. Brand new B737's with personal entertainment systems in both directions. The crew were fantastic on both flights. Breakfast and coffee was pretty good and throughout the flight the crew did a few rounds of the cabin offering bottles of water and handing out the extra muffins they had left over.

Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-LAX 21/6/14. Great service happy crew A380 great aircraft - quiet and smooth. Food ok hot snack good. Arrived on time. Onward to JFK flight up ok. Flight back to LAX 3/7/14 delayed due to storm boarded aircraft but sat on tarmac waiting. That is acceptable however the temperature in the economy section was dangerous even a crew member said it must be over 40 degrees. Of course the back section was the only hot area. The captain made several apologies but we still roasted. Food on this flight was a disgrace. Crew were great and agreed all was not good. Also the entertainment system had not been changed from the June program. A380 back to SYD 9/7/14 paid extra for exit row on upper deck discovered that this is really a walkway for passengers to get to the toilet. Food once again below standard wine some generic brand and no pre-dinner drinks allowed. One new film had been added to the menu. Service throughout the night was ok breakfast awful not even a bread roll.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew QF 78 from Singapore to Perth. I normally fly budget and they were terrible so Qantas was like heaven. Seats were comfy and spacious lots of leg room blankets pillows and staff were friendly. That was one thing that has improved over the years - the friendliness of attendants. The plane was well kept and clean compared to the budget ones. Flight was smooth and on time. Food was so so but no complaints from me.

Qantas Airways customer review,Melbourne to Darwin and Alice Springs to Melbourne on B737s. Both flights were smooth and pleasant. Bag drop at Melbourne and check-in at Alice Springs (no check-in kiosks) were easy. Due to strong winds which affected the incoming plane the Alice Springs to Melbourne flight operated about an hour late. On the 4½ hour flight to Darwin a pleasant cold breakfast was served (yoghurt muesli etc) and just before landing a couple of biscuits and mineral water. On the return flight from Alice Springs my vegetarian roll looked better than the squishy meat pies and sauce served to the other passengers. The seats were comfortable enough for the flight sectors. The second flight was booked using Emirates frequent flyer points. Unlike a previous experience there was no problem checking in online via the Qantas (not Emirates) website 24 hrs beforehand.,0,8,Michael Little,2014-07-01,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,We travelled to Melbourne from Dubai on QF110 in economy last month. I have flown Qantas for forty years and each time I fly the seats are more cramped and the service is reduced. Never again. My seat 67B would suit a child of 12y or younger. My knees came to within 5cm of the seat in front of me and when the girl in front lowered her seat it was right in my face. I could not stand up to get out of the seat but had to crawl across the seats to get out. I am 70 years old so this distressed me and I could not face 13 hours in such a cramped situation. The staff were kind and as the plane was not full (am I surprised!) my partner agreed to move to another seat freeing up the three seats for me and allowing me to lie down. We had already flown 7 hours from Madrid with a 2hr stop over in Dubai so were very tired. I slept for a few hours on the mini seats but the armrests don't completely disappear so it was very uncomfortable. We had 2 meals in 13 hours all forgettable. However the wine helped. I am not heartless and did swap places with my partner to allow him to lie down too for a while.,0,2,J Jennison,2014-06-25,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,3,2,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF28 Santiago to Sydney in business. The seat was very very comfortable the service was exceptional and the main course was delicious although not so the rather boring pumpkin empanadas that I chose for starter. Qantas flight attendants are some of the most attentive and professional I have come across. The amenity kit was nice and included what one would expect. The printed menu was a bit too casual and three were left for me which was a bit confusing because they were all different. It took me a while to realise (small letters which I find hard to read) that two were from the previous Sydney to Santiago and Santiago to Rio legs (on 11 June the Rio service was a special for the World Cup). Qantas certainly are well above the average and are different in many ways from other airlines. They try to be so different that they do not have a sign for the Business or First classes check in areas in Australia but instead there is just one in black that says Service. This is annoying and idiotic. I went the length of Sydney domestic terminal trying to find the Business class check in area which of course I did not find and was directed to the 'Service' area by a Qantas employee.,0,9,Harold Bush,2014-06-25,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew QF702 MEL to Cairns and QF703 Cairns to MEL. The two flights were as different as chalk and cheese. Flight up was not enjoyable at all. The food was an inedible tasteless disappointment with no choice as to what you would like. Lucky we brought some snacks from home! No seatback IFE only a shared boring movie on a screen I could not even see. Come on Qantas entertainment is available on Jetstar for a cost but who cares. How can you expect people to just sit there for 3.5 hours. The small shared screens are an absolute joke. Please either use newer planes with IFE flights 3+ hours or give out ipads Q streaming as is done on the 767. Flight back was on the new VH-XZO with IFE and the food was a lot better and with choice this time. What a difference it was like flying a completely different airline. I really hope these inconsistencies are dealt with. I have always been a fan of our national carrier but why pay more if you are getting less then budget airlines are offering. Will recommend mainly on the basis of safety and punctuality.,0,7,L Green,2014-06-23,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew business class MEL-CNS 9.30am departure was late due to change of wind. A last minute arrival of a family in business class = parents not seated together so I moved to allow the couple to sit together opposite their two children. I suspect last minute upgrades or Qantas family on standby. The 737-800 was the next gen so very new with very good ambience and good quality entertainment however very poor meal service bread no salad - main was fruit salad or two eggs with chorizo and spinach. Despite a lunch service and 1.30pm arrival wine not offered but I think you could request it. I feel that if I was paying $1000 for the ticket I would feel upset but I was using points to upgrade and so was the passenger seated next to me but he paid double my costs as a last minute booking.,0,7,John Smith,2014-06-20,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew SYD to LHR return in economy and I noticed the little extra no longer exist with Qantas in economy. The food on both legs was tasty however the serving size small. The wine was nice and drinkable and no complaints when I asked for refills. Whatever happened to the hot towels? Whilst Qantas still advertise a basic amenities kit on both flights these were not offered. I found the staff service was friendly and efficient. As a gold FF member I put in for points upgrade and was lucky to get short DXB to LHR leg on outbound flight but would seem very hard now to get an upgrade on this flight. The possibility of the upgrade is why I choose Qantas over Singapore Airlines. Return flight home was delayed by 3 hours with an SMS notification which was later updated to inform the flight was on time only to turn up to the airport for and find out the flight was delayed so a 6 hour wait at Heathrow. The flight was only half full so I extra space made the seating more comfortable than it would have if packed in. All in all adequate but there is a reason why flight is half full hard to maintain the brand loyalty when other airline products are similar priced and better.,0,6,D Cummins,2014-06-18,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways

We had seats 70j and 70k and I am 6 foot and I could fully extend my legs and lock them under without hit my kneecaps on the seat in front. There was plenty of food and snacks.

Qantas Airways customer review,QF9 outbound MEL-LHR on 3 June and QF2 inbound LHR to SYD on 13 June both with stops in DXB. Most of my mainline trips to London Dubai Singapore and HK are on Qantas craft. Despite all the criticism I have to say that Qantas on the mainline routes have upped their game. Excellent service from FA's. Meals can be a little inconsistent but have generally found this when the catering is resourced from London in particular. As a comparison my wife travelled out earlier on Emirates also on their A380 service. Same metal but more cramped and an inconsistent level of service from the FA's. No real negatives on either of QF2/9 save the usual gripe about the wait to disembark the A380 which applies to all.,0,9,N Jeram,2014-06-16,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF2 Heathrow via Dubai to Sydney. Paid a lot for an exit seat but not worth it as on the aisle near the hatch which the crew use to go to their rest station my feet were continually bumped as they queue up to enter the light just in side the door was annoying and the door banged every time so forget any rest. Surprised at the poor quality of food curry or lamb stew on Dubai leg the curry AGAIN or macaroni cheese on Sydney leg. Breakfast was a muffin so arrived in Dubai hungry had to buy breakfast from pain quotidien which was best meal on the trip! Crew were very ordinary. All in all not as good a flight as Thai gave us on same trip 3 months ago.

Qantas Airways customer review,Canberra-Melbourne return. Although only 45 minutes in the air my ticket for the outbound leg said that dinner would be served. So I was surprised to get a tiny very cold chicken and lettuce sandwich. And that was it. You know what it's fine to not serve a meal on a 45 minute flight but don't say that you will. The crew were terrible. They were miserable rude and surly - with the exception of the cabin manager who was trying hard to make up for the rest of the crew. A passenger in front of me asked for some ice with his drink. The attendant called (yelled) to another attendant in the galley for ice who yelled back down the aisle that there was none. She then made an excuse that no ice is loaded on such short flights. After the fuss died down a miraculous cup of ice was delivered to the man by the cabin manager. Return flight got shifted to an exit row as I was boarding - a nice surprise. Crew were a bit nicer this time but still not great. Short TV show on overhead screens.

Seating comfortable meals were of good proportion and quality was excellent. Wine selection and quality good. IFE selection was varied and up to date. The addition of the mattress to the seat makes a huge difference and the PJs add to the comfort of sleeping. Service was friendly and relaxed. I think this is the hallmark of flying Qantas.

Qantas Airways customer review,MEL-SIN on an A330. As a long time QFF I was a little disappointed with many aspects of this flight. Our flight was delayed 2 hours due to 'faulty cockpit part' which had to be flown down from Brisbane. My partner and I travelled in Economy - the seats were dated with little leg room. The entertainment system was old tired and responded poorly to commands from the remote. The food was reasonable with a tasty side salad and a good offering of drinks and wine. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. The flight was three quarters full so we were able to spread out during meal times. We arrived late but gladly at one of the best airports in the world - Changi. On international routes (aside from its flagship MEL/SYD-DBX-LHR) Qantas compares poorly with competitive modern and innovative Middle Eastern and Asian airlines. I suspect most Australians who fly Qantas do so for the QFF points - which day by day diminish in value and are harder to earn. Particularly on a route to Singapore the options for better cheaper and more modern travel are best serviced by Emirates or Singapore Airlines. Offering the more popular Premium Economy options is one way. More modern aircraft (think: Dreamliners and A380s) and a more diverse menu offering are other helpful ideas.

Qantas Airways customer review,Absolutely fantastic in every aspect our business class flight from Hong Kong to Sydney was amazing. The flight attendants were very polished and gave exemplary service. The food was good and the seat very comfortable. I cannot complain about a thing.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew MEL-SIN-MEL on QF 35 and QF 36. Staff were professional meals were ok. My travel was booked with a partner airline (who performed the next two legs of the journey) and as such when I tried to purchase extra leg room seating was refused. The only saving grace was that both flights were not full and was able to move to spare seats. Top marks for effort for those on the transfer desk in Singapore. Realistically there is more room between the sates of a V-line country train than economy class on Qantas.,0,5,T Isaacs,2014-05-29,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,3,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Brisbane to Darwin. Poor tired planes. Outbound ran out of food. Inbound 767 with ipads for the entertainment system. 4 cabin staff to service a 767 who spent most time trying to get the ipads working. Flew Qantas back in 1994 - remember now why we don't fly Qantas.

Qantas Airways customer review,LAX-MEL and SYD-DFW. May 2014. The LAX-MEL flight was delayed about an hour or more due to arriving passengers from JFK. The A380 mini Business Class Cabin with three rows is quiet and comfortable. My ear phones were not working and a couple of FA's offered to have me sit in the lounge to watch a movie which I did and they brought me a snack. The device did work afterwards in my seat. The flat bed really helps on a 15 hour flight. The food service was great. FA's were ready to offer any food and beverage throughout the flight. SYD-DFW had a great crew- exceptional attentive personal service. Chose 5J on the reconfigured 747-400ER and love that solo window/aisle seat. Food was good breakfast is the best and presented to you from the galley- not on a cart. ( pancakes fresh fruit smoothie/energiser drink tea toast with jam - you will not find this in the U.S.). Great conversation with a FA during landing as the Crew seat is in front of the 5A/5J seats. Slept for 7 hours on the 14 hour flight love the flat beds and the option for a mattress cover and blanket/pillow to add to the comfort. FA's are so eager to make up the bed unlike Domestic/U.S. airlines. This was one of the best experiences flying internationally second to Cathay Pacific.,0,9,Jim Ash,2014-05-29,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-BKK-SYD in Business. I think QF is really stepping up with outstanding service for tough competition. Great customer service on board QF 23/24. Staff are very professional and friendly provide personalised service to business class passengers. Food and wine was very good. First class toiletry bag was given to business class passengers. Sydney first class lounge is fantastic as usual. BKK QF lounge is improved as well. It was excellent flights.

Qantas Airways customer review,AKL-SYD. Business. Excellent TransTasman early morning flight. A short 3 hours with good personable service good fresh breakfast and actually very good coffee. What singled Qantas out was their help with getting me to a connecting flight in 60 mins. There was a medical emergency on the flight and I thought I would not make the connecting flight. The crew got me off and had someone escort me to my other flight. That was amazing considering this was not a Oneworld partner. Qantas really stood out from the pack!,0,10,S Adlam,2014-05-28,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew business New Zealand to Brisbane 25th May. Used points and I am glad we did. If I had paid for this poor excuse for business class I would be more annoyed than I am already. Old scruffy dirty seats that obviously are or were Premium. Food slop (get rid of Perry!) Only two choices of wine? Never would I fly short haul business international ever again with Qantas. So very overpriced and certainly not what you would expect in (supposedly) Business Class. Flew Emirates BNE/Auckland. Chalk and cheese. What business should be! After almost 40 years with Qantas I now give up. I am at the age to want to enjoy comfort when travelling but will be looking at other airlines as if this is business on Qantas - forget it.,0,2,Sylvia Hogan,2014-05-27,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,3,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,SYD/DXB on the A380. Was upgraded using frequent flyer points. A very acceptable product. Very cute little lounge area at the nose of the cabin to chat to passengers over a glass of wine and watch a large TV monitor. Configuration of 2+2+2 is a little more cramped than SIA (see earlier review) but still relatively acceptable. Although seat width is smaller by far the flat bed is very comfortable. Good food and wine. Altogether a great experience if one's upgrade application to use points has been successful. Would definitely choose another off peak flying date and repeat the journey to DXB on the flagship A380.,0,8,Philip Peace,2014-05-27,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Same day Brisbane to Sydney (return). Flew down on QF8 (which departs/arrives international terminal) which is a 744 with new interiors. Flight great and a wide selection of IFE. The staff were friendly and even made a mandarin announcement for a Chinese tour group on board while we were delayed at SYD on the tarmac due to a late departing aircraft at our gate. Return trip was QF524 on Boeing 763 with ipads available. Again staff excellent and friendly. Only comment on both flights is that the cost cutting is quite evident with shrinking portions and less options (even at meal times). Overall though the QF domestic experience is outstanding.,0,9,J Huang,2014-05-25,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,3,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Brisbane-Los Angelesand Dallas Brisbane in Premium Economy. Worth the extra price. Great service attentive staff who go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.

Qantas Airways customer review,QF3 and QF4 Sydney/ Honolulu return. Having read the dire reports of this particular route we went equipped with an extra inflatable cushion each plus a neck roll. The seats were not as bad as we expected although as cramped as you would expect in Economy. The price for travelling Business on this route is outrageous. Boarding at Sydney was a complete shambles. All the departure boards announced that the gate was open. However when you arrived at the gate there was a surly security man ordering everyone to sit in a holding bay next to the gate. Countless people turned up at the gate and explained that the boards said it was open to be given no explanation but ordered to sit elsewhere. The problem was that there was a JetStar flight to Honolulu that was late leaving and all their passengers were also in the holding bay. There was not one announcement as to what was going on. Occasionally a passenger would be called by name and allowed through but the rest of us had to stand and endure the glare from the security man. Eventually a woman security person turned up and was much more amenable but was muttering about 'security' procedures. Eventually they opened the gate and all the passengers went through. By this time the Qantas and Jet Star passengers were all mixed up and of course after the Jetstar flight had been called and was about to close there was one poor passenger who was still mingling in with the Qantas passengers and almost missed his flight! It was then announced that it was the 'late arrival of the cleaners' that had caused the problem. Total shambles. Onboard the cabin crew were cheerful and willing to help. The service of drinks is a bit bizarre they don't serve a drink before the meal so if you don't want wine (which was vile) you end up having a gin and tonic or other aperitif with your meal. Or not as the case may be. On the return leg I asked for a G & T they said they would bring one back but never did. I couldn't be bothered to ask again. The food was fairly awful. My husband had something described as pearl cous cous it looked like spider's eggs and tasted of nothing! The ice cream after dinner was the best part of the meal service. The Ipads are a complete waste of time the sound is terrible and after trying to get two or three to work we gave up. The staff must hate them as they seem to spend a lot of time sorting them out! On the way back boarding at Honolulu was very well organised. The plane was full but the cabin staff again were very good. Two of the call buttons got stuck and kept pinging every few seconds for about two hours but eventually they managed to stop the noise. Again the food was forgettable. All flights were on time and we arrived safely so that's what counts but 10 hours was quite long enough!,0,7,H Thompson,2014-05-23,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,2,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-SCL (Santiago)-SYD on QF27/28 again in Premium Economy. This almost feels like a 'flagship route' for Qantas these days. These flights are excellent and interesting and offer (if one is lucky) unbelievable views of the Antarctic Ice Shelf especially at this time of the year as the aircraft follows the necessary 'Great Circle Route' to and from Australia. Top professional service and a sense of a quality product on these 747 flights .I only wonder why Qantas doesn't offer Premium Economy Seating on its A330 flights into Asia as does Cathay Pacific. I'm sure it would be a winner.,0,9,Roger Stone,2014-05-21,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Melbourne to Sydney and onto Hawaii and back on QF3 and QF4. After boarding found that the aircraft was older than others however we did not have an issue with the seating or leg room the service and meals were more than satisfactory and the crew were fantastic on both flights. If you would like to be critical the iPads take a while to get working if they don't work all together the cabin crew are very quick to replace it with another most of the time it was just a matter of turning it off and re booting. Both the domestic flights were also good as we travelled with a family of four we also found the baggage allowance of two check ins per person by 23 kg fantastic. When booking the flights our travel agent got Qantas as the cheapest out of Virgin Hawaiian and Jetstar.,0,7,T Annan,2014-05-21,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Sydney to Melbourne. After an overnight JAL flight from Tokyo to Sydney I connected with a QANTAS domestic to Melbourne. I made the mistake of taking carry on luggage that was way too heavy. The staff were quite understanding and arranged for it to be stored until the plane landed in Melbourne . It says something of the quality of the staff that they were understanding and patient when a mistake like this is made by a customer.

The entertainment monitor was difficult to get out (bent or damaged fittings perhaps?). Staff appeared tired and unenthusiastic food on par with cafeé food (stale tasteless). Service is inconsistent. Bit of pot luck whether you will get reasonably good or poor service. Loose panels on wall and disgusting state of washroom suggest Qantas is cutting spending on maintenance and cleaning.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew SIN-MEL on 10/5/2014 Economy. First question why don't airlines and I only fly Qantas place families with children throughout the aircraft and not in a designated area on the plane preferable at the rear of the plane. Secondly we had a miserably crew flying back (a great crew flying up) it seems that returning crew are not that interested in serving or smiling and on this flight took ages to serve a simple meal.

Qantas Airways customer review,Caught flight from MEL-DXB-LHR. I'm always concerned when I catch a flight because in all reality it comes down to two things - food and staff. I have said it before and I will say it again Qantas needs to dump Neil Perry. His food selections and food inspirations are 'tripe' and while some people enjoy that most don't. On the other hand the staff were great. Acknowledged me by name and were very attentive. All in all a good flight but one that will always be marred due to the food IFE was OK buy could do with a wider selection.,0,8,G Thomas,2014-05-10,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,I flew Sydney to Christchurch in economy class. Check in went very smoothly and staff were very helpful. There was a 45 minute delay for the flight. But the airline did apologize for it and said that it was due to bad weather. When we boarded we were welcomed by a smiling and friendly cabin crew. The plane was a brand new 737-800 which had an almost spotless cabin. The seats were very comfortable with plenty of leg room and a reasonably sized IFE. The food was great and was very filling. The toilets were also clean and fresh.,0,7,Tanmay Bhakta,2014-05-07,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,4,5,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew Brisbane - Dubai - London on A380. We were lucky enough to snag seats 32 J&K which are a pair of bulkhead seats in the economy section on the upper deck. It was a peaceful oasis at the back of the plane. Seats were comfortable and we had plenty of legroom due to the bulkhead. Storage bin in the side was excellent for storing handbags coats etc for easy access. Service from staff was excellent. Very friendly and efficient. Food was surprisingly very good. Drinks and fruit/snacks were offered regularly throughout the flight. I hope we are able to snag these seats again next time we fly. So much better than the downstairs economy section. IFE was good with plenty of movies games TV shows and music to choose from.

Qantas Airways customer review,Travelled with the family from MEL-JFK on PE class by QF93/107 on 5 April and return by QF108/94 on 19 April. Overall very satisfied value for money and PE class stood for its rating. A380 hands down is very quiet and spacious. Transit experience at LAX can be very exhausting but can't be blamed on QF. Flight deck update apt including sharing the flying route and vantage views. Seat legroom and comfort fine but would have preferred little more leg rest adjustment features. Noise cancelling headsets provided amenity kit provided onward but not provided on return. Table linen service with menu cards and real cutlery provided. Two options for main course and breakfast provided but Neil Perry recipe can reconsider the meagre dessert servings; food little bland and not appealing. Welcome drinks with bubbles a special by QF compared to other competition. Stand out was the staff on board - genuinely friendly courteous and engaging in short conversation. Onward flight supervisor personally introduced addressing last names and walked through the features of the cabin and service. On return leg night flight one of the crew woke all sleeping passengers to advise them to eat since it is a long flight and breakfast was not for another 12 hours - a very caring touch.

Qantas Airways customer review,LHR to SYD via Dubai on an A380. Overall the Qantas product is average at best which is a shame given the excellent product that once it was. Boarded aircraft at LHR and offered a drink however once finished glasses collected and despite a 2 hour delay nothing further was offered. Not sure what the current procedures are on Qantas however once the plane had finally taken off it was another 2 hours before a meal or drinks service was offered bringing the aggregated time of almost 4 hours without any service. This is simply not acceptable when compared with the competition. Once the service had commenced the food and drink offering was significantly more Spartan than previous trips on the carrier. The stopover in Dubai was OK - the emirates business lounge was enormous however the one thing that was not sufficient were the shower facilities with a 30 mins wait despite the overall lounge being almost the size of a football field! Once on route to Sydney service again was slow following take off demonstrating that the London leg was not a one off. The IFE package was however excellent and the seats on board very comfortable. Something that does seem a waste of time is the so called on board business lounge and self service bar. Tiny area with the offering at bar comprising of a half drunk bottle of red wine 3 cans of coke and 3 packets of crisps. If this is the offering suggest that Qantas consider removing this facility and replace it with additional toilets as every time I went to use these facilities there was a 10-15 wait which is something one hopes to avoid in business class. On arrival in Sydney everything worked like clockwork and returned to the levels of service that I had previously associated with Qantas. Suggest that this airline needs to spend more time focussing on the overall service provided rather than gimmicks such a new uniforms.,0,6,S West,2014-04-24,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,2,N/A,1,4,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,QF172 - Wellington to Melbourne on 21 April 2014. After the negative press that Qantas has been receiving recently I felt it necessary to comment at how exceptional this flight was. I was a little hesitant initially given that the aircraft (B737-800) was a narrow aisle aircraft and was operated by Jetconnect crew. How wrong I was! The plane itself had a variety of IFE options. The staff were brilliant warm perceptive and on top of every passenger's needs. The only critique would be the food options - unfortunately the Cajun fish I had was a little bland. I was happy to receive a great beverage service something lacking from many airlines.

Qantas Airways customer review,Caught QF616 from Melbourne to Brisbane and still Qantas cannot get it right. One staff member checking customers onto the flight makes a joke of the priority line especially when the staff member is stationed behind the general boarding check in.

Qantas Airways customer review,DXB-SYD in seat 32J which is in the front row of the upper deck economy section of the A380. Extremely quiet and surprisingly smooth (usually I find sitting toward the back of a plane rougher ride). Used their Dubai Connect service due to 8h+ transit from Casablanca. Very efficiently handled by Emirates/Qantas. Would say I preferred Qantas over EK because the cabin staff were warmer and showed their personality. Also there were countless rounds of the cabin with trays of snacks and drinks. IFE was excellent.,0,9,Rod McGuire,2014-04-21,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,I have always received excellent service from Qantas. In particular I thoroughly enjoyed a recent A380 flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne. The flight attendants were friendly yet professional and the A380 was great too. I particularly loved the self-serve snack bar and in-flight entertainment on the A380 as well as how quiet the aircraft is.

Qantas Airways customer review,The Qantas club in Perth was nice with the usual inclusions service and food on the plane were great but the key down was the oldest seats I have been in since I was a teenager. The entertainment system is poor with no individual screens manually adjusted seats. The worst part was my feet were hard up against the row 1 when I had the chair reclined and when I has to get out of my seat I would hit the drink rest in between my seat and the next as there isn't a lot of room between rows.

Qantas Airways customer review,Excellent customer service. A better than expected trip overall. Gone are th edays of the extra snacks and ice- creams between meals. But hey do you really need them? I don't normally get into the inflight entertainment but this time there were programs of interest. Only annoyances the crazy prices for date changes. The fare was already considerably dearer than competitors. Furthermore Thailand is number one destination for Australian travellers. Why don't they fly a Bangkok to Melbourne route? Not everyone wants to travel Jetstar. Going via Sydney is a major and exhausting inconvenience.,0,7,J Salman,2014-04-10,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,1st and last time with Qantas SYD-DXB-LHR A380 Business. Seat comfortable timings good food/service 3/10. Ran out of the chicken option and having returned inedible bath sponge covered in cheese I asked some toast and marmalade. Served 2 sliced barely warmed white bread and jam as they had run out of marmalade. No magazines or duty free mag and mattresses removed 1 hour before we landed at LHR. Cabin Steward rude and huffed if we queried anything. Code share with Emirates miles away from Emirates service.,0,4,Caroline Parsons,2014-04-09,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,2,N/A,2,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Singapore to Brisbane on March 30th in J lower deck. Had an exit-row seat (5J) which was great and comfortable. The food was nice and so were the wines too. The cabin was served mostly by two bored male crew-members with no smiles what I am not used to on Qantas flights.,0,6,K Pellberg,2014-04-09,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,2,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,December 2013 from LHR-DXB in business class on A380. After sitting on the aircraft for 5 hours the flight was announced cancelled and we all had to disembark. During the 5 hours onboard we were not served food even after asking for at least a sandwich. We were not allowed any hot drinks in case we were going to suddenly take off - which was very unlikely! We were asked to keep our seats upright also in case we were going to suddenly take off! We were then left with no information regarding our next flight details. After managing (with great effort and with absolutely no assistance from Qantas staff) to transfer onto Emirates 18 hours later than initially scheduled to depart. Arrived in DXB without baggage! After disembarking the plane 5 hours later without being served any food Qantas refused to even provide dinner. The worst service I have experienced from an airline.,0,1,A Laila,2014-04-09,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,2,N/A,2,2,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,My wife and I flew Brisbane - Hong Kong QF96. Having done some review reading we had mixed feelings about what to expect. Arriving in Hong Kong we agreed that it was a really good trip. The aircraft was a bit aged and due to be replaced in a few months. Not before time. This meant the screen were small and image quality uninspiring. They did have a solid collection of new movies TV shows and we had no problems finding something to suit. The main meal was hot and very tasty. The later meal of pizza was soggy and to honest mushroom while I love them are not for everyone. The service of the cabin staff was outstanding. They went out of their way to deliver quality service.,0,9,P Simmonds,2014-04-07,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew from Brisbane to Singapore Qf51 the revamp 747 to A380 spec is great. I am on a plane 4 times a week so I know what I'm talking about. I never thought I would say this but Qantas now has the best international service and business class. The Asian carriers still have good service are Singapore/Cathay but their food and options have dropped in quality. The overnight sleeper beds of Singapore are better on the 777 and A380 though. For many years most of the flights I took with Qantas the crew would serve lunch/dinner than disappear for the rest of the flight to the back.,0,10,G Paynter,2014-04-06,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF16 Los Angeles to Brisbane is one of the best flights into Australia. It departs from the American Airlines terminal in LAX (rather than Bradley) which means that connecting AA flights bring you conveniently to an adjacent gate. The plane has the upgraded business class seats and IFE which compare well with other carriers. The service and food are fine. I have used the flight several times and it has been on time. Australians tend to criticize Qantas but if you live in North America it is a relief to get on one of their planes. What I don't understand is why it is almost $2000 cheaper if I purchase the flights from a Canadian or US site than from an Australian site.,0,8,D Henry,2014-04-06,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,"My wife and I recently booked a reward flight Brisbane/Perth in business and then Perth/Brisbane economy. I fly a lot well over 10 flights a year in business class and up until recently with Qantas hence I earned Platinum. On the flight back in economy from Perth to Brisbane I was told by the flight attendant ""did I want the beef for my meal""? I asked if there was a choice and she said ""no do you want the beef""? ""Ok"" I said ""I'll have the beef then please"" she said ""I'll have to come back"" but she didn't. When I asked another attendant some 10 minutes later about my ""beef"" she roared with laughter and went off to see where it was the original attendant arrived back 2-3 minutes later and apologized with the ""beef"". I forgot to mention the back section of the plane where we were seated was barely half full and I am positive the attendant served the people behind me meals. I have flown with Emirates and Singapore as a Gold member many times around the world in both business and economy class and they make the effort to know your name and ensure your travel is comfortable nobody forgets meals or ""roars with laughter if they do. After that flight I flew to Manila with Singapore Airlines and the service was impeccable the food/seating was far better and the selection of entertainment was way more than Qantas. I think I will continue to fly with Singapore for now.",0,3,S Proctor,2014-04-01,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,3,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,CNS-SYD 12pm 23/3/2014. It has been a while since I have flown with Qantas but it did not disappoint. It was a full flight so since we were sitting near the back of the plane it took a while to get served. The food was great and the ice cream after lunch an added bonus. The new look cabins and uniforms were also nice and a great improvement. I am a short person so leg room doesn't bother me but it could be a bit restricting for a taller person. The only draw back was I couldn't get the complimentary ipad to work and neither could my travelling companion however having a decent movie to watch compensated for this. Only one side of my headphone worked but again there was nothing I could do about this so I couldn't see the need to cause a fuss with the cabin crew. Overall I was pleased and will consider paying that little bit more to fly with them again.,0,9,Bronwyn Hughes,2014-03-31,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,5,N/A,4,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,LAX-SYD return on A380 and SYD-AKL WLG-SYD on B737-800. Great service on all legs. Qantas knows how to make passengers feel comfortable in Economy especially in the long haul legs with the A380. Those who complain should pay some more money for bigger seats! Food drinks runs movie selection were all good. One catch for Oneworld travellers who use the Qantas codeshare flight on an Emirates plane. Qantas do not allow access to their lounges unless you are in Business or First even though you may be Emerald in the Oneworld system.,0,9,A Storey,2014-03-28,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF35 Melbourne to Singapore. I have been travelling this leg with Qantas for over 15 years and normally travel business class as I did on this occasion. I can tell you that the seats have improved but that is about it. The amenities kit is a waste of money. I do use them normally but compared with the past Qantas could save money and not start to replicate the type of services that they use on jet star. I would also suggest they get back to basics with the menu and ditch Neil Perry. The inflight entertainment range is getting smaller and smaller and if you are a regular traveller like me it starts to become tedious. My loyalty to Qantas once rock solid is I'm afraid no longer. Emirates is now my first choice. I should add the staff on this flight were great but only as good as the tools they are given to use.,0,7,G Thomas,2014-03-28,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,2,N/A,5,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,BNE-SYD-SCL (Santiago) -SYD-BNE. Superb flights. Qantas seems to me to have recently undergone a 'mood change' with a noticeable enhancement of service. Best aspects of this particular trip were the First Class Lounge at Sydney the American Airlines Admirals Club (which Qantas uses) at Santiago the excellent food and wines but above all the superb service despite a very full aircraft. If you get a good Qantas cabin crew you will get some of the world's best. Perhaps a word should also be said for the level of engineering and technology that we take for granted these days: it simply amazes me that an aircraft (747-400 in this case) can transport us accurately for 14 hours non-stop over the remote Antarctic Ocean in absolute comfort and safety and also arrive at destinations within one minute of scheduled times - incredible.,0,10,Roger Stone,2014-03-28,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flight was delayed 2 hours no drinks and snacks provided for the delay on the flight from SYD-HKG a little bit frustrating. The A380 was a little bit crowded as it was Christmas season peak. Staff were friendly as usual luggage fine check-ins are a little bit slow in Sydney. They need to make some improvements. TVs are good and kept me busy for the 9 hour flight meals were ok but a little bit rushed they need to deploy 1-2 more staff on a busy plane.,0,6,Peter Lo,2014-03-27,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Sydney-Cairns-Sydney. Business class. Very good crew for this domestic trip on both sectors. Seems more attention is paid to full paying customers than people using points. It's pretty obvious when the crew start engaging with passengers. Comfortable seating and good lounges at both locations. Food was okay and crew constantly enquiring about re-fills etc. Honestly crew made both sectors a enjoyable experience. Interior of the aircraft is pretty out of date.,0,7,M Stringfellow,2014-03-24,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,5,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,My latest trip was to Singapore and back and I couldn't fault the staff. They were polite welcoming and efficient. They were on the look out for passengers needing something and most often got to them before having to press the button for assistance. I did once and a crew member was with me within seconds. Flights were on time baggage was fine food was good and plentiful good variety of entertainment. My only peeve was that the arrow button on my handheld remote was stuck so I was limited with what I could watch but still had 8 hours worth I could use the 'up and down' arrows for. Good beers and wine on board too.,0,9,S Roche,2014-03-24,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew economy from Dallas to Brisbane in February and from Melbourne to Los Angeles (A380) in March and I love Qantas. I was served multiple meals on both flights and the service was excellent. The plane was new and clean. The in-flight entertainment system/computer was great with recent movies as free options to view through a long/overnight flight. The crew were hospitable and professional. Flights left and arrived on time or earlier than expected. I would strongly recommend Qantas for international travel.,0,9,Vicky Valerin,2014-03-22,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,"I had the displeasure of flying with the ""Red Kangaroo"" Business Class 20/3/2014 Melbourne to Perth. It's hard to really know where to begin - having flown Virgin Business to Melbourne maybe my expectations were too high. Unlike Virgin no champagne before take off no warm towel and no effort by the cabin staff to get on a first name basis. Old Plane tired 90's ear seat which was barely better than an Economy class Seat completely inadequate in every aspect. Inefficient cabin crew whose service appears false and scripted. 90's era Drinks trolley staff still push the slow tired drinks trolley down the aisle. The quality of the alcohol is ""woeful"". The Food Service Neil Perry inspired Menu international fare served on Perth - East Coast flights? - Complete Joke.

Qantas Airways customer review,First time on Qantas business overnight from SIN-MEL. Lounge at SIN overcrowded and noisy so moved to Emirates lounge. What a contrast! An oasis of comfort and attentive service and almost sorry to leave when flight time arrived. A330 business cabin one of the dullest and least appealing we have experienced but seat comfortable. Supper menu was a joke and by the time my wife and I came to chose our preferred choices were unavailable. My wife ended up with a crew meal not too bad but really is this what flying business class is about? We have flown business on 5 other major carriers and this experience puts Qantas right at the bottom as far as my wife and I are concerned. Crew however really did their best for us but admitted they were embarrassed by the menu.,0,2,A Sloan,2014-03-21,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,4,2,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,"SYD-SIN-SYD in Economy last month. Both flights on A330-300 and on time. Use of lounges and fast-track service at both airports due to OneWorld elite status. Seat for day flight to SIN was comfortable. IFE system a bit on the old side but there was a reasonable selection of movies and TV shows. Meal was tasty and of a good portion. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Return flight to SYD was an overnight flight. Seat not great for sleeping as legroom not quite enough. Maybe another 1-2"" of pitch would have made all the difference. Cabin crew were very good on this flight. I have been quite impressed with the service standards on my last few international flights with Qantas and they are definitely winning me over.",0,9,J Teoh,2014-03-19,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew Melbourne to Singapore on QF35 in March 2014. As a platinum member have flown Qantas a fair bit and really can not see why people rubbish them. A330 business class is fine for the MEL-SIN flight staff professional and friendly and always available. Lounges are some of the best in the world certainly a lot nicer than the MH lounge in KL where I am sitting as I write this! Good selection of films and the food is better than a lot of other airlines I fly on (eg Cathay Finnair Malaysia). I always prefer to fly Qantas and will continue to do so.,0,8,H Duncan,2014-03-17,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF15 BNE-LAX with an onward connection to SEA with AS on Friday the 14th March onboard a B747-400. The overall experience was above satisfactory on this 13 hour transpacific flight. The service was that of what you would expect from a full-service carrier starting from the ground at BNE. Excellent seat designs and seat pitch. The Economy Class food was a choice from three and these were premium selections and were considerate towards passengers with special dietary needs such as vegetarian. Premium selection of alcohol wine and soft drinks and with every hour the cabin crew did drink rounds. A snack bar was provided for passengers at the rear of the aircraft. The In-Flight Entertainment had ample choice of videos but their audio selections weren't as great as Virgin Airline's RED. Cabin crew were polite and civilized towards passengers. However I was scrutinizing the tiny details that would have made the flight truly exceptional compared to its competitors. The check-in personnel at BNE could not fully advise me on the cutoff time to drop bags with its codeshare partner Alaska Airlines. Qantas did not play any cabin music during boarding which would have set the ambience. No amenity kits were handed out for Economy PAX. The toilets were kept clean but had only basic toiletries (hand soap). No in-seat power for your electronic devices. Some TV channels on the IFE did not stream and there were no onboard internet. There was also a slight inconsistency with the service by the cabin crew when some rows were offered alcoholic drinks while other rows were simply asked what would they like to drink. Overall though it was a great flight.,0,8,G Gifari,2014-03-17,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,5,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew business class from Sydney to Hong Kong return on A380. Seat was great and comfortable to sleep. TV on one leg stopped working but the crew were very apologetic and moved me quickly. Service was very good and professional and has improved compared with the last trip a a couple of years ago. On the overnight leg however it took a long time for drinks and dinner to be served. Also breakfast did not include a hot full breakfast which is very poor for a business class fare.

Qantas Airways customer review,QF11 SYD-LAX March 10 2014. Outstanding service from Qantas staff both on the ground and in flight. Inflight crew constantly coming through cabins with water and other refreshments. Dinner and breakfast far superior to economy class on other airlines. Good selection of reading materials and assortment of snacks in the self serve snack bar. In flight entertainment comprehensive and intelligent. Qantas has designed a comfortable economy class seat which again is far superior to seating on other airlines - both European and North American. I'm a light sleeper but even I managed to sleep.

Qantas Airways customer review,Auckland to Perth 777-200 Airbus. Always wanted to try a different airline to compared to the usual one we fly so gave Qantas a go. Big mistake we won't be making again. It was a long 7.5 hour trip when you are in economy class with very limited movement squeezed in like sardines in a can! No leg room and trust me we are not big people! Seats were like sitting on a thin wooden chair they were so thin and hard. Meals were very bland no taste and really not inviting should of eaten before the flight. Staff were okay did their job to the best of their abilities. Overall flight was good no roughness but really couldn't wait to get off as was so sore from sitting on the uncomfortable seats. Overall we felt ripped off with the price of the tickets and extra purchase of luggage at a ridiculous price per extra 5kg it was not worth the change in airlines.,0,2,C Burke,2014-03-14,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,3,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew Sydney to Perth and back at the weekend. Airbus 330-200 on both ways. New A330-200 from SYD to Perth. Big screen IFE seat back. Sliding new seats. For me it was very comfortable although not sure its good for the back on long haul flight these new seats. On the way back older A330-200 with smaller seat back IFE screens but still enjoyed watching new releases movies. Ordered vegetarian meal wasn't disappointed. Hot meals. Free drinks. Very good quality. Excellent staff service. Departures and arrivals on time. I traveled around the world with dozens of airlines.

Qantas Airways customer review,"LHR-DXB (Codeshare with Emirates) 15/2/14 on QF2 using an A380 for first time (Long standing BA customer) so pre- flight was quite excited at the prospect and to be frank was not disappointed. Big spacious cabin on the upperdeck in J Class comfy seat and a very quiet flight. However the level of service by Qantas is sadly lacking and clearly starved of resource no pre-take off drink offered 1st drink 1hr into flight no offer of subsequent drinks ""meal"" of Hot Salt Beef Sandwich was inedible etc. In absolute contrast the return fight on an Emirates B777 was exemplary irony of older plane (but still very nice) but incredible service couldn't have been more polarising hot towels x 4 champagne pre-take off wonderful meal and extensive and regular drink service if anything was too regular lucky I had the chauffeur service at the other end.

Tickets were purchased with frequent flyer points so value for money not relevant. The seat was comfortable and folded down into a flat bed. The staff were cheerful happy and always ready to help with anything.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew Melbourne to London and back last week. It was the worst trip I have had there and back. The food was very poor we were watching the trays after every meal getting packed away and they were hardly touched so we were not the only ones who thought so the breakfasts were shockingly bad. The flight crew from Dubai were very unprofessional complaining out loud about the airline and their shifts. Qantas advertise on there own page about enjoying a hot chocolate this is only offered once each way from Melbourne to London and Back. No ice creams offered as advertised. The self serve snack bar food is plain and boring offering plain biscuits nuts and small cake bars.

Roared out of Tullamarine ten minutes before scheduled departure time with the captain announcing that the plane had been given an early landing slot at Sydney and we were going to get there as quick as possible. Captain announced that this was the aircraft's last commercial flight with Qantas. Flight crew were cheerful and offered beer and wine on the flight. offering everyone a second round as the cabin was lightly booked. 20.30 Flight back was pleasant however service was somewhat more contrite and being a weekend flight alcoholic refreshments were not complimentary. Aircraft was an equally dated 767 which had been refitted but still looked tired although the flight back contained the iPad streaming IFE which works well. Otherwise an overall pleasant experience.

Qantas Airways customer review,MEL-PER-MEL QF653/476 on the 24/01 - 27/01. Flew Business into Perth and Economy back to Melbourne. Airbus A330-200 both legs. Flight to Perth was delayed 20 mins at boarding with no announcements over the PA or at the gate. Cabin was modern and clean. Seats in business were very comfortable with plenty of legroom which is to be expected. Good range of TV and movies on the seatback IFE. I was offered a refreshing glass of pear and strawberry juice upon boarding. Nice touch. The 3 course meal served during flight was good and beer and wine was topped up cheerfully throughout the flight by the very professional flight attendants. Towards the end of the flight the crew had run out of James Squire in the business cabin but were more than happy to source more from economy for me and chill it right down. Flight back was in economy and was in a modern and clean A330-200. Cabin was nearly full but flight attendants were friendly and professional. Hot lunch was served which was satisfying and beer/wine was offered throughout the flight. Good range of IFE for a domestic economy flight. Overall very pleased with experience.

Qantas Airways customer review,BNE-PER-BNE two trips in 3 weeks and very pleasant flights. Good service free wine and reasonable food for economy. On one flight I boarded with an upset stomach and the flight attendant brought me some quality white wine from business class which helped enormously. Generally very full flights but on-time departures. I especially appreciated the careful route track selection to avoid headwinds on the westbound flights and to take advantage of these strong westerly winds for the eastbound flights meaning all flights either arrived exactly on time or were early. The Perth Qantas Club lounge is huge but at peak hour is still somewhat difficult to find space to sit down. Qantas have very annoying and intrusive people mover buggies sounding their warning sirens while moving around their Brisbane terminal (also the same in Sydney and Melbourne) - and mostly just transporting crew and friends about - what's wrong with a bell or soft honking horn as is the case in terminals such as Hong Kong?

Meal was good service was good and managed to sleep for most of the flight.,0,8,S Donnelly,2014-02-24,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,"Singapore-Sydney in January then Melbourne-Singapore in Feb. Check-in staff in Singapore were excellent. The cabin crew on the first leg were friendly and talkative although the ""supper"" service was far too slow for a night flight. We were never actually given a meal for the flight just a ""supper"" and ""breakfast"" (just yoghurt and a banana). Mine were gluten free and pretty average. Melbourne-Singapore the food was far better although the ""salad"" was a tub of mixed leaves and nothing else. The check-in agent in Melbourne flatly refused to give me an exit row aisle seat for free saying I needed to pay $90 despite getting it for free (due to impeded legroom) twice before. Poor staff knowledge. IFE was pretty good.",0,7,J Atkins,2014-02-21,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,3,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF36 Economy Singapore to Melbourne on 15 Feb 2014. Full flight owing to the start of the Australian university term. Huge difference from the superior A380 that used to ply this route - seats on the A330-300.were old IFE sets small and mine was not working properly for some reason. Upgrades are needed quickly lest Qantas loses out to other airlines on this route. Supper and breakfast service was ok nothing special. Cabin crew professional throughout. Coffee was atrocious. Arrived in Melbourne on time and bags on the luggage belt within half an hour. All in all decent service but could be much better. If you're flying from Southeast Asia Qantas is ok if you they have a good deal for tickets but if you're paying full fare it would be better to stick to Singapore Airlines.,0,7,D Lee,2014-02-20,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Melbourne to Darwin breakfast flight at 8.30. Flying into Darwin on morning flights the only city you get a hot breakfast out of is Perth so was expecting another bland offering on this flight and it did not disappoint. Thankfully Melbourne Qantas Club had plenty of nice offerings to fill up on before the flight. Again a boxed meal (if you can call it a meal) served a tub of muesli with yoghurt and a bag of apple slices. Not sure what is going on with Qantas and their catering but it seems like a budget offering and it will be a shame if this is the direction Qantas is going. Bring back proper meal service I don't mind paying extra this is why I have always travelled this airline.,0,5,Paul Williss,2014-02-20,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,1,N/A,5,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Sydney to Melbourne continuing on from Darwin. Great food in Sydney Qantas Club. Refreshments are advertised on this flight so don't expect anything too much at 8.30pm on a flight little over an hour long. Flight full and service good but refreshment a little disappointing - sweet biscuits and nothing else. Free wine was served so can't really complain. Managed to get an extra leg-room seat which is always good.,0,6,Paul Williss,2014-02-20,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,3,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,MEL-DXB on the A380. Last section of the plane was only a third full thus giving each person 3 or 4 seats usage. Nevertheless the reduced number of passengers didn't mean that inflight service diminished on the contrary service became nearly one-on-one and was outstanding. Good entertainment system although the LEDs are a tad small and are not the best for screen clarity. Music channel options are fantastic.

Qantas Airways customer review,This is the first of my three negative reviews of Qantas. Flew Darwin to Melbourne via Sydney. I fly Qantas domestic refusing to fly Jetstar or Virgin simply because cannot be bothered with budget airlines. Lunch-time flight out of Darwin. New plane nice crew spare seat between me and fellow passenger. Lunch served was appalling! A boxed lunch made up of buckwheat and brown chicken slices hardly appealing. No dressing no bread roll nothing. If this is the path Qantas is taking it's a pity.,0,5,Paul Williss,2014-02-19,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,4,2,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF 824 on 28 Dec 2013 and QF 825 on 1 Feb 2014 BNE-DRW-BNE on B767. In this 4 hours flight a breakfast of muesli and fruit slice was served. For some passengers like myself this was just too small. Service from the cabin crew was quick and efficient so they weren't chatty. Snacks (cookies) was served prior descending. The flight back had less passengers and it was this trip that left a good impression. Ordered a vegetarian meal and was served a quinoa salad. The cabin crew took pity and they serve me the main meal which was roasted vegetables. Ended up chatting with the cabin crew. Ice cream was served prior to landing and I got two servings. The second was placed on my table to my surprise as I got back from the washrooms.,0,8,G Gifari,2014-02-19,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,In November 2013 my wife and I booked Premium Economy for return Flights to Hong Kong in late January. In November we accessed the advance seat selection and altered our seat allocation to window side seats in the A380 on both outbound and inbound flights. When checking in on the internet the day before departure we had been relocated to the middle seats on the way out and in separate seats on opposite sides of the aircraft on the way home. On complaining we were informed that I must have failed to complete the seat selection properly. That did not ring true as the reallocated seats were different to the original seats prior to the advance seat selection and the original allocation would have remained so if I had not changed the seats.,0,6,David Dowling,2014-02-17,no,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,3,N/A,4,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew economy on QF51 Brisbane to Singapore on a 747. The check-in experience didn't make for a good first impression. The lady at the check-in counter was extremely rude and grumpy. However check-in was the only negative aspect. The flight departed on time. The ageing cabin crew were friendly enough but you got the impression that they were doing no more than they had to. The food and beverages exceeded my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was more than adequate. The seats were comfortable and the 7.5 hour journey seemed to pass quickly.,0,8,S Rane,2014-02-17,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,3,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Tokyo-Sydney leaving 1950h overnight 9 hours. Arrive 0700h. Boeing 747-400. Qantas is not making money and this is certainly reflected in the quality of its business class travel which appears to be cost cutting severely. No champagne offered before takeoff. No dinner! Supper is what it's called. Ran out of the 2 Japanese choices early. Small green leaf salad and 3 other choices. Dessert on menu but not offered. Sake on menu but not available. No hot breakfast available unless you count toasted sandwich. Comfort kit is possibly the worst of any business airline. Some moisturiser toothbrush and paste socks and eye mask. Not a flat bed but reasonably comfortable. Good blanket and cushions. No privacy screen. Crew tried hard but obviously tired. Good range of screen viewing choices.,0,5,S Kurian,2014-02-17,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,3,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,"MEL-LHR on QF9 - A380 on 8 Feb 14 Business Class. The A380 is easily the quietest and nicest airplane to fly on. Staff and service were near faultless on both legs (Melbourne to Dubai and then Dubai to London). They were attentive knowledgeable and efficient. The meals were pretty good in general. I had a rack of lamb for dinner with some quality wine. What I'm not happy with though are the Business Class seats. They are very ordinary indeed and there are much better offerings available from many other airlines. The seats are ageing lack storage space and seem to have functions that no longer work - at least my seat was like this. Wobbly armrest and a TV that wouldn't lock down in place. The footrest is particularly uncomfortable as in its folded position it sits ""proud"" of the rest of the seat. The tray table was unsteady and made for some interesting balancing acts for food and drinks. There is very limited space to put drinks on the narrow shared arm rest between seats with not enough room for two drinks to sit side by side. If you have a window seat you don't have direct access to the aisle and end up having to leap over the person next to you if they have their seat extended for sleeping. Even with the new ""mattress"" to put on top of the seat for sleeping the seat is still hard and you end up with sore hips / back after a short period of lying down. The service was great - friendly and efficient. They're charging a premium price without providing a premium product.",0,6,M Sinko,2014-02-12,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,4,N/A,5,2,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Melbourne-Singapore 31 January Economy. A very comfortable flight. Excellent friendly service. The food was good but could have been a bit more substantial.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew economy from Honolulu to Sydney during the day. All was reasonable excepting the entertainment that I was looking forward to to pass the time of day away. Adult movie selection was 4 B grade movies. The ipads froze for 10 seconds every 3 minutes. The sound was not audible through the earphones. The attendants answer was that it was the movies fault and a replacement ipad did not make any difference.

Qantas Airways customer review,"I was pitched into the Qantas flight when my chosen BA flight was cancelled. It seems the Qantas A380s often fly with a lot of spare space. My long flight from Sydney to Dubai was rendered intolerable by a crying infant but the comments that follow concern only the Qantas provision. Cabin crew: brusque and uninterested in passengers. From start to finish all members gave the impression they had a lot of hard work to do. Why is a smile something so difficult to provide? There was no pre-service of aperitifs (even though aperitifs were listed on the menus handed out at the start). The food was excellent: I really enjoyed the taste of all that was offered on both legs of my SYD-LHR trip. Wine appeared to be supplied grudgingly and there was no offer of ""seconds"" of coffee — routine on BA flights. Legroom on the A380 was adequate. The plane was clean. The seats were not comfortable — after a bit their hard pressure on the backs of the thighs became annoying. The ridiculously low maximum weight limit for Qantas cabin baggage is a major reason for avoiding this airline regardless of other considerations.",0,5,F Odds,2014-01-31,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,5,N/A,1,2,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,We booked our holiday with Qantas to fly from London-Sydney-Fiji-Sydney-London. The journey from London through Dubai to Sydney was superb. Excellent service provided by the ground and inflight crew. Flight attendants were generally friendly and helpful. Food for kids and adults alike was delicious and portions were just right. We enjoyed the return trip from Sydney to London via Dubai. Unfortunately the Sydney-Fiji-Sydney route was a disaster it was operated by Fiji Airways. I hope Qantas will use one of its own fleet to service the Sydney-Fiji route and back.

Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-SCL business class 747 with new seating arrangement with seats designed for the A380. Had an emergency exit row window seat upstairs which seemed to me to be the best on the aircraft. Ample storage space around the seat. The only drawbacks of the new layout are that you need to climb over your neighbour to get out at night from the other window seats and the overall metallic grey colour scheme is decidedly dismal and depressing. The flight was punctual and the cabin service of a very high standard indeed. Lunch was excellent with even a desert wine available.

Qantas Airways customer review,Travelled DRW-SYD 16/1/14. It was our daughter's birthday so we upgraded our economy seats (row 4 - what a mistake) to business with hard earned FF points. Refurbed seats - mine would not work at all daughter's worked after assistance. I could've moved but I wanted to sit with my husband. FAs were pretty good reasonably attentive but our kids were asleep when breakfast was served and when they did awake they were not offered anything not even a water or juice. Our breakfast was appalling. I am gluten free but instead of getting GF bread I was given rice cakes! Cold eggs cold beans cold tomatoes. No bacon no sausage. No fruit no yoghurt. Overall the trip was bad we were really disappointed.,0,4,A Thompson,2014-01-31,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,3,2,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Flew SYD-MNL-SYD on QF19/20 in Business. QF19 is a day flight and although it's around 8 hours no PJs are offered in case you want to have a sleep. Crew were friendly and efficient and with a little prodding provided me a set of PJs (albeit XL). Food was surprisingly good - had the linguine with sardines and tomato. Flight departed on time and arrived slightly early - almost a first for Qantas. The return flight is a nasty overnighter departing around 7.20pm local time and arriving around 6.30am to Sydney. Sleep is very uncomfortable on the older angled beds (Airbus A330) so only dozed for around 2 hours. Again the food offering was good but the airline is definitely penny pinching offering only a 'supper' (instead of full dinner) and a 'cafe style' breakfast rather than the previous a la carte service. Crew were outstandingly friendly and efficient - a real credit to the airline in this instance. Qantas IFE is still amongst the best in the skies in terms of choice  although my screen did crackle a little on both legs (seat 3K). The sooner Qantas buys the new planes (eg B787) the better - the older A330s with the old business class simply don't compete with the other major carriers. A refurb is due later this year but it's too slow given the current offering by competitors.,0,4,S Koffman,2014-01-30,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Living in Asia there are not a lot of route choices with Qantas especially as they have recently withdrawn a lot of their Asian flights and/or downgraded from 747 and A380 to A330 aircraft. However as I am still a Qantas Gold member I decided to remain loyal and travel back to Brisbane (via Sydney) from Bangkok. This flight used to have Premium Economy but since the introduction of the 330 aircraft there is only Business or Economy and so because of the exorbitant price for Business Class ($3920) I chose to travel Economy. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable with a ridiculously small amount of leg room (I am only 178cm so I have no idea how a tall person would cope). The seat fabric and carpet was very worn and faded and stained and the entertainment system only worked for the first 2 hours of my return trip. The food was terrible but thankfully the wine was good. However by far the worst issue is the FA's most of them have obviously been in their jobs way too long and no longer seem to enjoy what they do and show it through their couldn't care less attitude and lack of attentiveness to their customers. I am now thinking about taking my loyalty to Malaysia Thai or Cathay Pacific all of which are far better and less expensive than Qantas.,0,2,S Walker,2014-01-29,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,1,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,I flew to Japan on QF21 on 18 January on a 747 and returned on 25 January on flight QF26 an A330 both legs in Business. I had seat 1C going there and 2C on the return journey. The seats are very uncomfortable for Business these days. They are very angled and with the bulkhead directly in front of me on the trip there and the seat pod on the way back the seating felt very claustrophobic. The fact that Qantas still does not have all aisle access seats in 2014 is beyond me and in both directions kept being woken up by my neighbour clambering over me during the night. On QF 21 I ha the crew going into the storage cupboard all night and banging the door shut again disturbing my sleep. The food now supplied in Qantas business is pitiful. I think the Asian and Middle Eastern airlines serve a better meal in their Economy cabin than Qantas does in its Business cabin. Furthermore they have done away with the refreshment hot towels. On both legs towels were offered only once and that was just before landing in Sydney nothing on the flight to Narita! The crew on the flight to Narita would have preferred to be anywhere else except on that flight. The crew on the return flight were better but cannot be compared to the Middle eastern airlines crew for attitude and service. I am a Platinum member of Qantas but will not fly them again on an international flight on an aircraft operated by them. The cost cutting is very evident in the services provided to their Customers. As other airlines lift their game with service offerings Qantas are cutting theirs?,0,1,I du Plooy,2014-01-29,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,1,N/A,2,1,Qantas Airways

A private cabin with a dedicated crew seats are more roomy than economy (2/3/2) better pitch and meals are of a high standard. Used the pre-ordering system 'Q-Eat' for the first time. A good initiative from Qantas an extra section for each meal not available on board. Beverages are excellent and the option of freshly toasted sandwiches on demand.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew AKL-SYD-HKG on 737 and A380. The Trans-Tasman service was the early business shuttle with a Jetconnect 737-800. Firstly the IFE itself was fantastic same provided on the A380. For a 3 hour flight it was more than satisfactory. The screen itself was large and at the perfect height for viewing. The seat itself was rather narrow and the seat pitch was rather narrow (and I have a height of 5ft 5!). However we can attribute this to the size of the aircraft. The Flight Attendants themselves were fantastic and were overall bright and cheerful for the early flight time despite one haughty young woman (no more than 20) who was leering and smile-less for the entire flight. When I merely asked her for a blanket and pillow she gave me a scowl as if it were the hardest thing for her to do. However the overall flight was great. On to the A380 service to HKG. The seat pitch was more than sufficient and the width was great. The IFE screen was large and had more than enough entertainment for the 9 hour flight. The Flight Attendants were bright and cheerful for the whole flight and the catering of lunch and pizza bread refreshment was hot and fresh - probably due to the introduction of induction ovens on the A380.

Qantas Airways customer review,After two days of flight cancellations and reschedules very happy to have arrived back safely in NZ after a surprise gift by my children of a return flight to Seattle for the 2013 Christmas break. I fully commend the ground staff cabin crew and every other QANTAS employee that I encountered on my journey for kind and efficient service. Demonstrated excellent customer care service from my point of view. Nothing was too small or big a deal to ask about and I felt genuine warmth from the cabin crew even after over many hours of catering to everybody else's needs both on my way to LAX and returning from LAX. The cancelled flights in L.A resulted in Qantas putting us up in a Hilton Hotel in Anaheim and we even got food vouchers! As we had missed our connecting flight in Sydney once again Qantas provided lovely overnight accommodation at the Rydges Hotel again with more than adequate food vouchers.,0,8,M Fepuleai,2014-01-20,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Final sector from Dubai to Melbourne QF 10 Jan 14. We had paid for exit row seats and the extra leg room was most appreciated. I was most unimpressed when we boarded in Dubai (after the London - Dubai leg) to find we were unable to use the overhead lockers which we were compelled to use because the crew had their luggage there. When I questioned why I was told there wasn't where else to put it. As customers who have paid extra for these seats I believe the crew should put their luggage in the hold or in another area in the plane. Crews attitude quite patchy.

Qantas Airways customer review,Melbourne-Canberra and return in B737s. Very smooth check-ins at the kiosks and bag drops. On both legs the planes operated on time or a little early. The cabin interiors were a bit tired and the seats a bit tight but the in- flight service was friendly and the snacks served were fine. Wine and beer were available on the late afternoon flight from Canberra. I travelled using Emirates Miles. I could not check-on online on either the Qantas or Emirates websites. The seats I had chosen when booking on the Emirates website were not honoured by Qantas.,0,8,Michael Little,2014-01-20,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,OOL-SYD QF865 Jan 14 2014. Check in was seamless and very speedy with very good staff. Qantas Club at Coolangatta Gold Coast is not as good as Sydney but was still quite good. Boarding started 30 mins before flight and was like check in very speedy. Cabin Crew very courteous and attentive. IFE was old drop down screens with QEntertainment but the News and Double Episode of Modern Family was quite enjoyable. Also the 12 radio stations were entertaining during take off and landing. Food was a dinner of penne with cream of pumpkin sauce and chicken which was good and it came with a small chocolate and water. Soft drink or wine were also offered. However no beer. Qantas T3 in Sydney was good and arriving from Gate 8 seems to be my lucky charm. As usual my luggage was the very first bag onto the carousel. Taxi line was short and was in a Taxi in less than 5 minutes.,0,10,J Busworth,2014-01-20,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,BNE-MEL-BNE in mixture of economy out and business back. As is often noted in these columns if you get a good Qantas cabin crew they are the world's best. The FAs in business were superb and extremely professional. Lunch service and wines excellent. Only downside on this trip was that the business lounge in Brisbane (used for business class and platinum members) was closed so one had to endure a bunch of yobs and their beer and noise in the normal Qantas Lounge. Impossible to work in the normal Qantas Lounge that day so better to sit and work outside in the boarding area. Shame Qantas don't have a dress policy for their lounges at least just to exclude the dirty singlets and flip-flops mob. However I am again pleased to recommend Qantas to others.,0,8,Roger Stone,2014-01-20,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Last year we flew on the A380-800 from LAX-SYD on Qantas economy. The seats were comfortable and the foot rest was a bonus. On this sector dinner and breakfast was served. For an inflight meal I couldn't fault it. IFE was extremely good for a 15 hour flight and not to mention the skycam feature. On the IFE people you were able to message each other from different seats. Qantas crew was caring and attentive and kept walking around the cabin asking for refreshments and so on. A snack bar at the back of the aircraft offered soft drinks and snacks if anyone was picky. Overall it was a smooth flight and thoroughly enjoyed.,0,10,K Mullins,2014-01-17,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,4,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,I fly regularly (4 times a month) from Perth to several regional destinations in WA. I always fly with Qantas on these sectors and have to say they have their good and bad points. The good points are planes always on time (never had a flight delay longer than 5 mins) food is quite good and IFE on the 737-800 quite good for domestic travel. The bad points; seats in economy are possibly the most cramped and un-comfortable of any airline I have ever flown with even the newer 737-800 aircraft have a very tired and old look and feel inside some of FA's seem to just go through the motions and boarding at Perth Airport is just a cattle stampede but that is not all down to Qantas. On a side note the few times I have upgraded to Business Class it has been a wonderful flying experience and one of the best regional domestic business class offerings. Far better than what the Americans call 'First Class' on their domestic routes. Overall a pass mark for Qantas just.,0,6,B Le Quesne,2014-01-16,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,3,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,19th Dec PER-DXB DXB-LGW QF8423 and QF8011. Return 7th Jan LGW-DXB QF8010 and 11th January DXB-PER QF8424. Had the misfortune to travel on return economy flight to the UK via Dubai on a Qantas ticketed flight the carrier being Emirates. This was my worst air travel decision and flight experience ever in 40 years. The customer focus of cabin staff from the point of boarding to alighting on the two legs outward bound legs of the journey were appalling and I cannot think of anything positive to say. The return journey was only marginally better and the cramped condition of economy seating cleanliness of the plane poor standard of food and inattentive crew made the long haul flight for the most part unbearable. I would usually rate Qantas as an adequate carrier no more no less but it's ticketing partner Emirates will do nothing to improve the perception of Qantas' reputation. If you are looking for a long haul Qantas flight that tickets through Emirates Airline seriously consider using an alternative airline.,0,1,Adrian Morgan,2014-01-16,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,1,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,"Jan 14: SYD-MEL-SYD. It has been 5 years since I flew domestically although I still fly internationally a lot. The planes were very clean and comfortable. FA's were excellent although perhaps lacking a lot of the spark they used to have. Flights were both on time and very efficient. What shocked me was the food offering. Since when did flying Qantas become a no frills airline in terms of food. Served in cardboard boxes the food was uninspired. Breakfast was a hard cold cake/bread type of ""thing"" along with yoghurt and granola. The coffee was dreadful. Dinner was a cold chicken and potato salad. What shocked me was that you used to get a proper breakfast and dinner hot and quite tasty for airline food. The food was delivered so quickly and taken away so quickly it was like being in a cheap cafeteria. While Sydney Airport is immaculate and very well presented Melbourne Airport was dirty and looking very worn. Sydney Airport was renovated for the Olympics and is well maintained and updated. Melbourne looks like it did 10 years ago and like it hadn't been touched in 10 years especially in terms of maintenance. I wanted to try out QF to see if I should use it again internationally but frankly I get much better quality in terms of food comfort entertainment service and price by flying Cathay to Paris regularly.",0,5,G Alexander,2014-01-15,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,5,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,I fly between Canberra and Brisbane quite frequently and have to say that Qantas are simply the best! The cabin crew are outstanding as are the aircraft they use on these sectors. Brand new 737-800's and the Qantaslink 717's. The entertainment is far superior than the competitor and the overall service and experience is just wonderful. I agree with a few other people when they say how lucky we are in Australia when it comes to service. You only have to fly on some other airlines to realise how fabulous Qantas is. My flights have always left bang on time and arrive on time if not early.,0,10,Clinton Pope,2014-01-14,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,We flew premium economy with Qantas last year in August / October return Sydney to Dubai with ongoing and returning flights from Europe to and from Dubai in Economy with Emirates. We were very happy with the Premium Economy experience and if we could have flown the whole way with Qantas we would have been even happier. The seats were comfortable the food and wine great and the service very attentive. For those of us on normal incomes Business is unaffordable and not justifiable but Premium Economy makes the long haul flights less tortuous and bearable We were so happy with the flights that we have rebooked for our holiday this year but would have to say we are not looking forward to the economy sectors with Emirates because the legs to Rome and back from Paris were very poor in comparison.,0,9,Lydon Amanda,2014-01-14,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,SCL-SYD and SYD-HKG in business. Flight from Santiago to Sydney did not get off to a flying start due to a ridiculous check in system that took 20 minutes at the counter and another 10 minutes waiting in a line for a point to point journey. Unacceptable for business class. Flight was on-time and the Boeing 747 was complete with comfortable fully flat beds which while in a conventional forward layout were incredibly spacious and converted into a full length bed. IFE was AVOD had a good number of options which while not as extensive as some ultra tech savvy carriers like Emirates was wonderfully edited with excellent selections. The food was wonderful with a clear emphasis on fresh food that included a number of options prepared onboard. I loved the flexibility of choosing from an extensive menu at any time instead of the conventional set options at set times. The crew service was mostly exceptionally warm and attentive save for one crew member who seemed totally out of place. SYD-HKG was on an A380 and once again the check in time was far too long although the agent herself was efficient and friendly. Boarding staff greeted me in Hindi. A380 had the same seats and was immaculate. The small lounge area was a nice touch. The catering on this leg was excellent beating the high standards of the previous legs and I can safely say that it was one of the best inflight meals I have had. Crew were friendly attentive relaxed and very efficient. I was overall pleasantly surprised. There are some issues however particularly check in and certain crew and ground members that are marring the work of other staff who are going above and beyond and an airline that is trying to compete with the best in the business and seems to be pretty much up there particularly in terms of product quality. Overall better then BA Swiss Emirates and Qatar. I rate them at par with CX and perhaps just shy of sq.

Qantas Airways customer review,SIN-MEL (booked as EK8036). A surprisingly unfull flight on 29th December during the peak season with many passengers switching seats after takeoff. So I luckily had two window seats to myself. Attendants simply could not be bothered greeting passengers as they walked into the cabins (with one crossing her arms at the back of the cabin although she did turn out to be quite friendly). However service was friendly and attentive with smart use of torches to avoid disturbing passenger's sleep during the night flight. The medium size dinner and small size breakfast did leave me wanting for a little more food - although the crew happily gave me a banana on request. Inflight entertainment options were solid although screen was very small. Baggage was instantly available on the belt at MEL. Overall a satisfying flight although it lacks the sparkle of its competitor on this route Singapore Airlines which perhaps explains the high proportion of empty seats on this flight.,0,8,E Shek,2014-01-14,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Our trip from Singapore to Brisbane was very unpleasant. During our holiday we also flew with Emirates Cathay and Dragonair and all 3 were vastly better airlines to fly with. The seats on the 747 are the narrowest I have encountered and the armrests which could not be tucked away were an inconvenience a waste of space and made the seats all the more uncomfortable. The meals were pathetic and the flight attendants took forever to serve the meals. Furthermore our meal choice ran out quickly and the only available meal fish in kung pao sauce was spicy. The lack of a hot breakfast on the 7 hour flight was also disappointing and the breakfast of yoghurt and cinnamon scroll left us very hungry. The overall flight experience was awful. Qantas is simply incompetent and no competition for professional airlines like Emirates and Cathay.

Qantas Airways customer review,We travelled to Noumea after Xmas with AirCalin code share on a Qantas flight - I thought we were lucky to be on a Qantas flight initially. The check in process was great the boarding Ok but the inflight meal was foul. The hot breakfast option was poached eggs-these arrived hard as anything covered in disgusting beans with hard boiled potato-totally inedible. The bread roll was hard and the tea was stewed! Thankfully one hostess offered me a fresh cup which was better but still not enjoyable. I was very surprised as I expected better service from Qantas than AirCalin. We travelled back with AirCalin and the service was so much better the meal was enjoyable the drinks bread etc was freely offered even brandy at the end of the meal.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew First from Sydney to Heathrow via Dubai on A380 and was impressed by nearly all aspects of the trip. Check in at Sydney was a little chaotic as the First Class check-in area was overwhelmed by large families of Platinum members using the facility but then having the usual priority immigration and security available to premium travellers I enjoyed the Qantas First Class lounge. An enjoyable spa treatment. The food at the sit down restaurant was one of the best lounge restaurants I have been to. On board service was indeed First Class with staff making sure they knew all passengers by name and able to respond to any queries. The seat itself is comfortable and infinitely adjustable although the controls for it are rather complex and take a little time to get used to. Made up as a bed it is easy to get sleep with adequate privacy and space to sleep on one's side and upright it is good for relaxing eating and working. Inflight pyjamas were better than those provided by other airlines and the amenities kit more useful as well. The massage function is enjoyable although a bit noisy. Quality of food for dining was excellent although it would have been helpful to know that the supper menu either side of the Dubai transit was nearly identical. Large range of food items although I thought the dessert selection was rather poor and the champagne in the lounge was better than that inflight. Inflight entertainment system excellent with a good choice and high quality screen and headphones. Transit at Dubai is pleasant at the enormous Emirates First Class lounge although at the time I travelled the spa was closed and it wasn't entirely clear when the boarding announcement would be. On arrival at London we had the same experience as other travellers and it took 20 minutes for bags to arrive - hardly priority. As an added touch it was good to be able to use the AA Arrivals lounge for a shower and a quick cup of coffee before heading into town. An excellent experience competitive with others but unclear if it is good enough to justify the price premium over business.,0,9,S Wilson,2014-01-09,yes,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Brisbane - Auckland and Auckland - Melbourne. Flying 737s made these flights feel more like a bus trip than a full service flight despite paying full service prices. Brisbane - Auckland departure was delayed ~90 minutes - an experience that we've encountered all too often with Qantas. Auckland - Melbourne departure was likewise delayed by over an hour with the added bonus that our luggage (plus the luggage of another ~40 customers) wasn't on the flight.

Qantas Airways customer review,DUB to MEL. Economy upper deck. I was desperate to travel on an A380! But it was the worst flight I have ever experienced I was so very disappointed to say the least. I felt really hemmed in I'm not tall but the leg room was cramped even for me and I was dismayed to realise that one could not stroll about to get some form of exercise. Water was not offered neither was fruit as advertised I was genuinely thirsty and hungry.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew 27th December QF 924 SYD-CNS Boeing 767-300. These so called refurbished old 767-300 planes are the knee jolt reaction to Qantas cancelling it's Boeing order for the new 787 Dreamliner. First time to self check in at SYD Domestic staff were too busy chatting with one another to assist. Departure 15 mins late due to late aircraft arrival. Old aircraft which should have been retired by now poor quality refurbishment of interior / seats. Entertainment offered was an ipad which slotted into a bit of fabric in front of you the only problem is when the person in front reclines it is basically resting on your nose. Breakfast served was basically a yoghurt & drink really poor for a 3 hour morning flight.

Qantas Airways customer review,QF52 SIN-BNE then QF8 BNE-SYD in business class on a frequent flyer points redemption so I can't fault value for money. Also impressive were the staff on both legs and the comfort of the business class cabin on both aircraft. Like others comments before the cafe style menu out of Asia on the overnight flights has to go - it is simply not up to business class standard. A tired ham and cheese croissant for breakfast or a small fruit bowl the equivalent of what Silk air provided me in economy class on the connecting flight to Singapore! Contrast this with the full breakfast service on QF8 from BNE to SYD all in a rushed hour and a bit. Qantas proved on QF8 that it can be done.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew LHR-MEL-LHR return on A380. Outbound I sat downstairs booked extra legroom. The seat was very comfortable and the recline is great as the seat cushion slides out so the seat back doesn't recline as much as a normal seat. Foods was edible (it was much nicer on the LHR-DXB leg than the DXB-MEL leg). I managed to get some sleep too. Return leg I sat upstairs again in extra legroom seats. From all the good reviews I was looking forward to sitting upstairs but how wrong I was. I spent the whole journey to DXB with an inconsiderate woman in the seat behind me poking her screen and jolting my seat. She then moaned at me because I reclined my seat (when she was asleep). Another passenger then decided to shine an LED torch around a dark cabin looking for something blinding the rest of us. Cabin crew were brilliant though! Lovely attentive chatty happy!

Qantas Airways customer review,Round trip between LAX to MEL on business trip for approximately 16 hours in the economy section at the window (to MEL) and aisle (to LAX) seat with price tag of $2660 USD. Overall experience in seating was not pleasant rather painful experience. 1) Leg room space appears to be one of the smallest of all the planes I have traveled with. This leg room issue is made worse by the passenger in front of you if (s)he pushes the recliner back. With the recliner pushed back there is little space to enjoy the food. No wonder the movie monitor has great viewing tilt angle (top-bottom) as the screen gets so close to your face. 2) There is a rectangular shape power box on the floor between the middle seat and the aisle seat which forces your leg to be tilted while resting. You will need to place your foot at an off angle. (4) Rest room was very small so small that I couldn't even bend over to wash my face.

Some crews were even unfriendly and hostile. BNE-SIN on the 747-400 better entertainment systems and large AVOD screens.

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew BNE to MEL in December and back again. I realise Qantas is struggling against fierce competition. But it is keeping up. The aircraft's are now a bit old and really should be replaced. The food on both flights was acceptable although nothing to write home about. The IFE is still out of the 70s with monitors hanging from the bulkhead every few seats. The shows on a 2-hour flight are 2nd rate. Cabin staff on both flights was helpful and friendly. Seating on the 767s was adequate for a short-haul flight. Despite the shortfalls I still (at this stage) prefer to fly Qantas on domestic flights.

Qantas Airways customer review,"JNB-SYD in Business Class in 747 400. The flight was overbooked and my wife and I were unable to be seated together despite having had confirmed our seats upstairs twice in advance. The crew did not see it as their role to assist we were told by the cabin crew member in our section that we were ""lucky to be on board as they had sent people home"". No special meal for me was loaded for which the initial response was ""were you always in this class?"". Was served lettuce and melon slices and the vegetarian meal which I ate some of but left most of it alone. It did taste good however. Wine was pretty good service was generally poor and dismissive other than by the Inflight Service Director who was very professional and apologetic. Had an omelette for breakfast which was cold and was told that if I wanted to be sure to get a warm one to get up earlier as the oven doors get opened and closed a lot and so it was heard to keep food hot.

Qantas Airways customer review,HKG-SYD on an A380. Departure delayed due to an ill passenger having to be off loaded but the cockpit crew kept everyone informed of the situation. Seats are not the newest design but the airline supplies a duvet too fit over the cushions as well as pyjamas which really aid sleeping. The crew were very friendly and efficient making the trip all the more enjoyable. For example they got some balsamic vinegar for me as I could not use the dressing provided. My main gripe is about the food. The salad is just a few leaves and the main course I had amounted to a fancy Panini sandwich. Nice as it was it did not fit the business class image. Nor did breakfast which was a choice of either fruit one cinnamon cake or a spinach/cheese tart. Rather poor given you often get more in economy class on some routes. Baggage delivery at Sydney was quick which was good. All in all not bad for a first experience of Qantas but I think they really need to look at improving the food offerings on long haul judging by this flight.,0,7,R Mortara,2014-01-02,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,2,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Qantas 737-800 from SYD to ADL on 26th December 2013. Managed to snare the exit row aisle seat as being 6 ft 6 the economy seats are a bit of a squeeze for us men with a fuller figure! Walked into SYD airport and it was like a ghost town. I originally had an exit window but it's useless to me as I have to stoop down to see out of the thing anyway. A lady took my seat at the gate for which she was very grateful. This was my first time having a gluten free meal and it will be the last time on any flight 3 bits of boiled chicken and some chick peas and some soggy lettuce it was only eclipsed by the fact the rest of the people who eat normal food were eating something easily worse. .I did request a cup of tea and it did come promptly so that was pleasing.

Qantas Airways customer review,Darwin-Cairns. QantasLink to Cairns on dinner flight on Boeing 717. These planes are quite comfortable with more legroom than 737-800's. While service was good it was also a bit slack in parts. Plane was full (125 pax) dinner was served but no drink service. Dinner would have been nice if not overcooked. Dried pasta and limp bok choy with chicken. We were told drinks would be served after dinner after we buzzed flight attendants asking for a wine. That is fine though a bit annoying but the flight crew took their time in serving as they fussed over some baby. Overall flight fine but it would be good if Qantas could maintain an equal standard on all it's domestic flights. If it has the flying kangaroo on it's tail then I expect the same service anywhere in Australia.,0,3,Paul Williss,2013-12-30,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,3,3,Qantas Airways

Could not ask for better service. Food not the best. Too cold. Check-in HKG: Same as for MEL. Great service. Business Class Lounge HKG: Cleaner and tidier than MEL but staff just the same. Cleaned up those tables around the food/drink counters but not keen to go to the people sitting further away. Flight HKG-MEL: Flight attendants excellent yet again. Service top quality. Food much better. Uniforms. Not sure what to say. Very dark. Did not go with the happy pleasant outlook put forward by those wearing them. Business Class Cabin. Seats are dark and dull. Cabin needs some color/cheering up. Overall: Staff at check-in and on flights were fantastic. Business Class lounges and cabin/seats are average.

Qantas Airways customer review,"Economy flight from London to Auckland return. At 6ft 3"" I have nothing good to say. Far too many seats crammed into the A380.

Qantas Airways customer review,MEL-SYD on an antique 767. The new slimline seats are ok but pitch is woeful. iPad IFE clumsy but adequate content. As for food the cookie which was the full extent of a snack was awful. A full service airline? When VA introduce meals on all flights in 2014 Qantas is going to struggle. Qantas staff are either exceptional or truly awful never a happy middle ground. On this flight they were generally snooty. One FA was even chewing gum for half the flight! Inflight magazine was tattered with pages torn out. I checked the magazine in the adjoining seats and they too were in poor condition. To add insult to injury the seat I selected on line was not given to me.,0,3,Mark Barbeliuk,2013-12-29,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,1,N/A,2,2,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,MEL-SYD-JFK (via LAX)-LAX-SYD-MEL. All flights were pleasant especially those on the A380 and refurbished 747. The older 747 looked a little dated and the entertainment was not as good on the sector using that aircraft. Flights were generally punctual. Food was reasonably good on all flights and drinks were offered relatively often. Flight attendants were for the most part friendly. The entertainment system is very good on the A380 and refurbished 747 but continually freezes on the older 747s. Had a wide variety of movies television shows and documentaries. Plenty of leg room on all flights. Would definitely fly Qantas again.,0,9,J Morgan,2013-12-25,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,3,Qantas Airways

Landed in Sydney 10 mins early and baggage delivery was prompt.

Old looking interior in 737-800 had seen better days no personal entertainment options only a small screen that shorter people cannot see if more than 3 rows away. Staff were friendly enough food was average with soggy muffins and undercooked scrambled eggs legroom was equivalent to a low cost airline seat.

My partner and I were seated on the upper deck in the first row. A very private and quite place to be sitting. Service from seasoned flight crew was faultless as was IFE food and beverages. The breakfast service was fantastic and a well made latte by flight crew went down well. We both slept for 11 hours each making the 16 hour flight seem much quicker.

Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-SIN-SYD Dec 11 on QF81 and return Dec 17 on QF82. Flight out in business was one of the best we have experienced. An older cabin crew really knew how to look after their passengers. Food was OK wine was very good but service was absolute stand-out. Flight back suffered from the new 'supper' offering.

Drinks were never empty food was great (and I was a little concerned on that front in advance of the fight given some of the reviews) and well timed. Flight from SYD delayed an hour due to some twit that went missing then thought it was hilarious keeping a 747 load of people waiting!

Qantas Airways customer review,I flew with Qantas recently on the Sydney - Queenstown and the Christchurch - Sydney legs with a couple of infants. Though I had pre-ordered the food online 72 hours before the plane departure from my frequent flier account the staff on the plane didn't have the update and hence my children were served the normal food. During the return leg I had chosen the seats at the front-end of the aircraft and yet they put me at the back-end of the aircraft which was a bit disappointing. The lounge facilities (Gold member) at the Sydney airport were excellent whilst the lounge facilities in Christchurch could be improved a bit especially for the kids.,0,4,Vijayakumar Arumugam,2013-12-16,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,2,N/A,3,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Santiago and back on Qantas (BNE-SYD-SCL-SYD-BNE) Premium Economy - another unusual and not very satisfying experience. Service was very mixed - some flight attendants excellent some seem to have been in their roles for too many years and were keen to show it. Food and wine very good on Qantas PE possibly the best globally. The Big problem was the domestic connection on return in Sydney - what a shambles. The return flight from SCL was just 10 minutes late but already being aware from their schedules that I had about 70 minutes to make domestic connections I made special effort to ensure I only had carry-on luggage would utilise my APEC card to assist rapid immigration and have an Express Pass as well. Despite being a Platinum Frequent Flyer having my boarding pass properly checked at the International Terminal Transit Area as being valid for my next flight and then arriving at the new departure gate at least 35 minutes before the scheduled boarding time (an hour before scheduled departure time) when I was finally boarding I was then abruptly bumped off the flight 'as the Qantas computer advised it would normally be too late for someone to make my connection and so they had allocated my seat to another passenger'. By then I had been 27 hours without sleep and had to struggle to find a seat on that flight or next flight. It was an awful experience overall and one wonders how the IT programming and scheduling guys at Qantas develop such a program that causes such a problem. A final point is that maybe it is time globally for it to be acceptable to tip airline flight attendants for good service if they provide it. Although we are all aware flight attendants are primarily on-board for safety reasons surely it would be possible to tip the service component of their duties and perhaps make them happier.,0,5,Roger Stone,2013-12-16,no,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,3,4,Qantas Airways

Personable interactive cabin crew led by a formidable CSM (he even kept us personally well informed on the state of play in the Ashes match at Perth with a PA report for the whole plane on landing) quality service interesting and varied lunch menu complimented by great Australian wines and served at a leisurely pace. Boarding at a remote stand by bus and stairs hardly QF fault says more about the airport management than the airline with a personal and friendly greeting at the door. Slight delay in push back but kept well informed by flight deck crew.

Was a mid afternoon flight on the way up and was served a selection of cold meats and cheese as well as a warm bread roll and desert.

Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-SIN-SYD in economy. Both flights on A330-300. Check-in at First Class counters as a OneWorld Emerald member was fast and the agent was very friendly. Fast-track through immigration and security in SYD much appreciated. Qantas International First Lounge wonderful as always with excellent quality catering and very friendly staff. Priority boarding honoured on both flights. Seat was comfortable and there was a reasonable amount of legroom and recline. On-board catering was pretty good. Meals were of a decent portion and also tasty. Both flights were on time. Qantas Lounge in Singapore was nice with very friendly and helpful staff. Cabin crew reasonably good on the SYD-SIN leg (QF81) but they were great on the SIN-SYD leg (QF6). IFE was AVOD. Selection of latest releases was a little limited and the screens were a bit on the small side. Fast-track through immigration and customs provided on arrival in SYD. Aircraft were well-maintained.

Qantas Airways customer review,I traveled to Auckland New Zealand December 2-8 2013 on Qantas from DFW-BNE-SYD and AKL-BNE-LAX. The DFW-BNE flight used the refurbished 747-400ER and Business Class was amazing - two of the best Flight Attendants I have met. The service food beds amenities etc. were wonderful and the cabin was so clean and spacious. The AKL-BNE flight on a 737-800 aircraft was quite roomy in Business Class and had personalized service and great food. BNE-LAX used the older version of the 747-400 and had the old First Class used as Business Class b- felt like acres of space great food and again two great Flight Attendants in the cabin. The pre-order for breakfast is very smart on Qantas' part- love having it presented and not having to discuss and wait-saves a great deal of time!

On this aircraft each passenger was supplied with an Apple IPad which connects to the Wi-Fi onboard the aircraft and streams a variety of entertainment. We were served lunch on this flight and I was very happy with my meal choice.

Qantas Airways customer review,Adelaide to Canberra return via Melbourne. Two flights on 737-800s two on 737-400s (only four of these left in the fleet to retire thankfully as they're real rattlers). Flights booked on points but still attracted $165 in fees including a steep Qantas charge for the privilege. All flights departed and arrived close to on time. Service on board as one has come to expect - professional helpful but not intrusive. Food of high quality including a delicious pea soup with creme fraiche on one sector. There is a special Business Class lounge in Melbourne which is a nice touch. The only jarring note was luggage way back on the carousel on the trip over but in summary very satisfying.,0,9,Tim Reeves,2013-12-04,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Singapore to Sydney QF82 arriving 3 December 2013 was a huge disappointment. Business Class. Cabin crew seemed to be of low morale no extra spirit to help and were no more than going through the motions. I had to ask instead of being offered more than a few times. But it was very much inferior food (to Thai Singapore Emirates) that really was a bad shock. We had 'supper plates' instead of a full meal and 'cafe breakfast' instead of the previous full breakfast. I assume Neil Perry is under the control and budget of a Qantas bureaucrat.

Qantas Airways customer review,My husband and I recently flew from Sydney to Bangkok with Qantas. It is many years since we have flown with this carrier usually flying with Emirates which we consider to have superior service. It was interesting for us to conclude at the end of the Qantas trip that our opinion has not changed unfortunately. The attendants on Emirates are in our opinion more obliging more approachable and must I say a lot younger maybe explaining their increased enthusiasm for their job. This is an observation that we could not help but notice. At the end of the day customer service should be the main priority of these employees and if the enthusiasm and motivation to deliver this service has waned the company has a problem. Flight attendants are the face of the company and can spoil the customer's experience if service is not delivered in an obliging friendly manner.,0,3,Judy Benvenuti,2013-12-02,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,2,2,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Queenstown to Sydney on a new 737-800 in a full business class cabin. Check-in was quick and easy although we had to wait a few minutes for the check-in counters to open which in Queenstown happens 2 hours before departure. Qantas don't have a lounge at this airport but we were given invitations to the ANZ Koru Lounge which is located before the security screening area. It's a comfy lounge with fairly basic catering but a decent selection of beers wines and other drinks in the fridge hot soup breads cheeses and other snacks and good views of the tarmac and airstrip. The flight boarded on time and we were greeted on the aircraft by the smiling CSM. Pre- departure bubbly coats hung safety briefing done and we were away on time. Throughout this short flight the service was faultless the wines were good the food was nicely presented generous in portions and very tasty and we even managed to watch a movie on the seat-back AVOD system. Noise cancelling head sets were provided when we boarded along with a blanket pillow and menu. We found the leather recliner seats to be comfortable enough and although they obviously don't hold a candle to the Emirates A380 product that flies between Australia and NZ they were adequate for a comfortable flight across the ditch. Arrival into Sydney was on time there were no queues at immigration or customs and for the first time the SmartGate worked for both of us! Our priority baggage was on the belt after the first few bags and we were out of the terminal within 15-20 minutes of landing.

Qantas Airways customer review,"Sydney - Los Angeles on QF 11 the Airbus A380 on a first-class Oneworld award I had booked way back in January for November travel. I'm picky but this is everything I wanted it to be. Highlights were probably the Sydney First Class lounge plus wonderful caring service onboard great food and a comfortable seat with large flatbed convertible sleeping accommodations. Also just loved the in-flight entertainment particularly the ability to view the tail-mounted ""Sky Cam"" throughout the entire flight. Performance was on-time too. So were there any nits at all? Well the boarding music was a little funky for my tastes and the flight attendant kept lapsing into calling me ""Mr. Murphy"" rather than ""Mr. Murray"" (until I finally corrected her) but heck so many airlines don't even try to use one's name anymore.

Sparkling wine OJ water offered by friendly flight attendant. This is a long flight of almost 15 hours that went much quicker than one would expect. Possibly due to plenty of food and great wine. Premium economy is very similar to domestic business class. The fact Qantas offer snacks including toasted sandwiches at any time during flight really equals business minus not economy plus.

Qantas Airways customer review,DXB to LHR on A380 Economy Class. I picked up an inexpensive Emirates flight to Hong Kong and one of my options for the DXB to LHR leg was to fly on a code share flight operated by Qantas. I have never flown on the A380 nor have I experienced Qantas before I decided to take this option rather than stick with Emirates for the whole return journey. Sadly I have to say that this was a mistake. Emirates outshines Qantas in just about every respect. The first problem was not of Qantas's making insofar as we were delayed by over 2 hours in Dubai because of the late arrival of flight QF1 from Sydney. Obviously this is beyond the control of the airline. Embarkation was pretty chaotic. There was no call for families with younger children to board first resulting in kids blocking the gangways and frustrated parents attempting to get them into their seats before other passengers came along. Seats in economy are a little wider but they also seem to be lower so I was constantly scraping my shines when trying to extend my legs under the seat in front. There really does not seem to be much room from the seated position to the back of the seat in front of you especially if the person in front decides to recline their seat so watching a movie is not very comfortable. The entertainment on offer is nowhere near that offered by Emirates and as for the food – the best way to describe it was inedible. For supper the offering was a chicken filled wrap and tea or coffee. I know that airline food in economy is hardly considered gourmet class but this offering was disgusting. In comparison the Emirates flight from HKG to DXB offered a fish dish on Thai noodles or a beef bourguignon together with dessert and cheese and a granary bread roll a lot better than a floury disgusting wrap. The inflight entertainment on Qantas can best be described as adequate. Emirates entertainment is far superior. Finally a word or two about the cabin crew. On Emirates the crew members seem to want to help you. On the flight I have just taken it seemed like an Imposition to ask for anything. The crew were all in the galley area and I wandered down to see if I could get a cup of coffee. The looks I got from one stewardess in particular seemed to scream that I was being a pain. I am sorry to be so scathing about Qantas. I was looking forward to the experience of flying with them. Sad to say the expectation greatly exceeded the reality and Emirates will get my custom for all the legs on my next trip to the Far East or beyond.,0,4,Steve Bennett,2013-11-25,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,1,N/A,2,3,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,MEL-SYD on 767-338ER using FF points to upgrade. Business lounge and Qantas Club lounge were excellent. Flight on time and service was exceptional. Staff were professional down-to-earth and genuinely helpful to some elderly passengers who required assistance. Two meal choices were available and drinks were plentiful. (There was no problem in staff knowing the difference between drinks in the event that anyone required two varieties of sparkling water to be available on a domestic flight). Seats were very comfortable perhaps a little more so than usual as the aircraft was one of the few in international configuration.,0,10,A Huggett,2013-11-25,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,BNE-MEL-LHR return. Couldn't be much happier. Reserved seat booking was honoured. Had a short connection in Melbourne so was granted an earlier internal flight to have more time to clear customs. Hard working yet happy flight attendants on all legs even constantly coming through the cabin at early hours of the morning to look after the non-sleeping passengers. Only one out of the four international sectors were full but service wasn't diminished. 4 out of 6 flights on time the other two were early. After this experience I'm not so sure why many Australians think our flagship airline is so poor internationally. I've flown with other Asian carriers to Asia and across the Tasman and in my experience Qantas is right up there.,0,9,H Tyson,2013-11-25,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,ADL to SYD Economy have not flown Qantas for a long time and will try not to fly them again. Flight jam packed and the seats so narrow locked into the window seat the seat could not recline and really was the most unpleasant experience. Cheap ticket.

Qantas Airways customer review,Gorgeous old 767-300ER for the short hop and back from MEL-SYD-MEL. Boarding was smooth the crew welcomed us by name and the flight was on time. Departure from gate was great flight was smooth and snack was served on the mid-morning flight. Much the same on the way back but tasty dinner was also provided with James Squire beer - huge plus. 2-3-3 layout is fantastic and the iPads are great. 9/10 bar for the cost of the ticket although it is almost worth it if you can.,0,9,M Walsh,2013-11-21,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,"Flew from Los Angeles to Sydney October 23rd. Flight attendants could not possibly be less interested in service if they tried. Not one flight attendant offered to help with bedding or even inquire if I needed anything. Food service was dreadful. The flight attendant practically dropped the breakfast tray in my lap when she got around to serving it. The breakfast was nothing to write home about and what is it with serving the utensils from the freezer? I was so looking forward to flyng Qantas because I had heard good things about the service. Sadly my experience would hardly fit in that category. The return trip from Sydney to Los Angeles on November 12th offered friendlier flight attendants and better service but not enough to make up for the my very poor first impression. This flight departed Sydney around noon and ""lunch"" was not served until about 4pm Sydney time. What took so long? The ""snacks"" that you offer are basically junk food as even your ""fresh fruit"" is served in a sugary syrup.",0,3,B Campanaro,2013-11-19,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,1,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,MEL-ASP Return. Boarding in Melbourne was prompt as was the service. Seated in 1 D in Business and offered juice or water prior to take-off. Left on time and then offered 3 options soup chicken salad or cheese platter which was excellent. Landed ahead of time and very prompt bag delivery. Return flight was also excellent with a great meal and excellent wine. Staff were very good and most attentive. Both aircraft were 737-800NG with the new red seats and seat back screens.

Qantas Airways customer review,Melbourne to Sydney on a Boeing 737-800. Brand new plane the Captain said only delivered 3 days previously. Comfortable maroon leather seats plenty of room for a short flight. Configured 2-2 and only 3 rows. Good quality lunch with a jolly nice sparkling wine. Overhead screens but I didn't watch anything as I had a great view out of the window. Slightly delayed departure but early arrival as flight was a little over an hour. Check in quick with no queues. Baggage delivered promptly. Very efficient trip.,0,9,Michael Davies,2013-11-18,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Sydney to Honolulu on B767. I agree with some of the points raised by Christine Woodward on 2 October. This is business class from the late 80's. The seats were wide and I found them very comfortable and we had a good nights sleep. Its true that if you are in a window seat with someone next to you you cannot get out without disturbing him/her. But there are only 5 seats like this. The cabin is configured 1-2-2 so there are 20 aisle seats out of 25 total. I didn't like the iPad system. You were always looking down on it you couldn't watch while eating or when the seat is in the recline position. However the staff were great - very friendly and offered excellent service. The food was good as were the wines. Priority boarding of business class - and they stuck to it - turning back economy passengers and telling them to wait. On time departure and we were allowed to disembark first. We a good flight but this is an out of date product as Qantas know and I'm sure they will put the A330 on this route as soon as they can. But this is still much better than flying with JetStar who share the route with Qantas.,0,8,Michael Davies,2013-11-18,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Travelling CHC-SYD-PER excellent flights in business on both sectors. Morning service out of CHC then a lunchtime service out of SYD. On the SYD service the quality of the service food and beverages was top notch. 3 course meal was of a very high standard and the wine offering was superb. The A330-200 J class seating is not the greatest compared to the -300 models and Qantas is fixing these which is good as they will all be lie-flat in the future. All in all an excellent level of service for a domestic product which outshone another carrier I flew with in business on an international service a few days earlier.,0,9,Chris Fox,2013-11-18,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,5,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Domestic Flight Sydney to Gladstone. For a domestic flight within Australia it was a very expensive fare to pay. The aircraft used was way out of date.

Qantas Airways customer review,PER-SIN-HKG. Staff were rude arrogant condescending. On domestic Australian flights this is the norm but with more competition on international routes I expected better. After the flight I had trouble getting Qantas to credit my Frequent Flyer points despite providing them my number when I booked my ticket. This is the third time this has happened and after two unanswered emails it was only after a phone call that they credited my points. Qantas like to promise the world with their FF programme but when it comes to delivering they try to avoid to meet their obligations in the hope that they do not have to credit you the points they owe you.,0,1,V Batt,2013-11-13,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,2,N/A,1,1,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,QF1 - a mixed experience as I had come from a codeshare JQ flight that wasn't really a codeshare at all no thru checked bags and no advice about the transfer at SYD to QF1. Had I known that I would have flown direct from BNE on Emirates. The check in and onboard experience was very good I was in the small section in Y on upper deck - paid for but recommended as I slept most of the way to DXB. Food very good and comfortable seats - a good point to point trip but don't expect an easy JQ/QF transfer experience.,0,6,D Bingham,2013-11-13,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,4,2,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Sydney-Joburg business class best night sleep on a plane. Love the quilted mattress thing they put over the seat - looks thin but makes a big difference.

Qantas Airways customer review,Sunday evening flight Melbourne to Sydney. Had a window seat and already printed my pass at one of the many self- serve kiosks. Asked the attendants at the sales desk if I could change my seat after printing explaining I thought I was too late. She politely stated that it was ok a new one would be printed. Gate 7 at domestic departures Tullamarine Airport - the attendants were on time polite and had high standards of uniform. More importantly two people were scanning tickets to enter the gate not one. Entering the aircraft was greeted with more smiles including the head flight attendant. After take off she agreed to move me to the exit row given my height (190cm). Ipads in all the seats and also complimentary headphones before entering the plane. Flight attendants then walked down both aisles making sure anyone who missed them got a pair before take-off. Food was very good timely delivery with multiple takings and more service with a smile. So far dealt with 5 flight attendants - faultless. Drinks were great and they were very prompt with taking rubbish despite having a full 767. I was also offered to have my trench coat stored during the flight with the business class luggage very thoughtful. Flight was comfortable service exceptional farewell contained yet more smiles and I've never flown better in my life. Very impressed with the way I was treated.,0,10,N Vitas,2013-11-06,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-HKG Return. Economy. 747 and A380. Compared to other One World partners Qantas really does provide a great product. Tasty and plentiful food and plenty of additional snacks and extras throughout the flight. While the friendliness of the crew can be inconsistent this would be the only detracting feature. The A380 product seat and inflight entertainment is excellent. A satisfying experience that really could not be faulted.,0,10,Diffin Corey,2013-11-06,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,3,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Very rude check in staff! I was flying with Emirates from Wellington but since Emirates does not fly directly to Wellington I had a Qantas connection. My hand carry was a little bit over the allowable limit and they won't let me through! I would not have minded re-packing and paying the extra charges but the check in staff were so rude it made me react differently. First they didn't greet me with a smile and then they talked down to me. I support them being strict about policies but there should be room for common sense.,0,2,J Goei,2013-11-06,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,1,2,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,SYD to SIN on A330. Seat was horrible! I arrived in Singapore with sore thigh. They should have installed a footrest! Flight attendants were neither polite nor impolite. No smile no expression (except one cheerful lady). Seems like they are forced to do their jobs. I requested for special diet as I am a vegetarian food was edible but nothing special. Entertainment options was OK however the system is very slow difficult to navigate and very outdated. Some other domestic Qantas fleet has been equipped with touch screen entertainment system so why retain this old remote style IFE on-international fleet? Considering that the price that I paid wasn't cheap and with the same price I can fly with another airline with a better reputation I am expecting a better service.,0,6,D Vincensiu,2013-11-04,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,4,N/A,3,2,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Recently flew Qantas/Jetconnect from Brisbane to Auckland QF125 this flight leaves Brisbane at 6.45pm arriving into Auckland at around 11.50pm. Online check-in was easy and when we dropped our bags at check-in the staff were friendly and very nice. Once onboard the crew were welcoming and friendly as always with the Kiwi Spirit was sitting in row 15 leg room was good for myself and seat was comfortable meals were great and options for Beverages were just the same. Would recommend Qantas across the Tasman any day with it being one of the only Full Service Airlines that operate from Australia to New Zealand and these flights are all operated by New Zealanders so they are always friendly and welcoming with a Smile.,0,10,A Jopson,2013-11-04,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Travelled Sydney - London and return on QF1/2 in Premium Economy. Believe it was worth the sale price we obtained the tickets for but not the normal full price. The cabin service was excellent as we're the meals and entertainment system. The only downside of the trip was a late return into Sydney resulting in a missed connection. We were told we would be on the next flight but at domestic transfer we were told our domestic booking had not been changed and as there were no seats on the next flight we have to weight another hour for the flight after.,0,9,L Batman,2013-11-04,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Sydney to Santiago and return. Food was terrible Qantas have cut so many corners in recent times they may as well tell you to bring a packed lunch and your own drinks. Service was slow airplane turned into a dustbin in the 12/13 hours I was on it. Seats although reconditioned were not comfortable and arm rests didn't retract fully. In flight entertainment was ordinary. Very disappointing. I definitely wouldn't recommend Qantas for long haul international flying anymore - they've had it.,0,5,D Burgess,2013-11-04,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,1,N/A,3,2,Qantas Airways

Qantas Airways customer review,Flew DXB-LHR in Business on the A380. A bit of a bland product in my opinion. Very minimalist and lots of extras missing. Amenity kit not worth bothering about. The evening supper was difficult to eat on the tiny plates with and most ended up on the table cloth. But generous with the drinks and I had a few hours deep sleep on the very comfortable flat beds. Breakfast a la carte and pre-ordered was good and made up for the poor super. Would prefer Emirates any day on this route but it made a change.

Qantas Airways customer review,SYD-HKG-SYD in Premium Economy - two of the most unusual flights I have ever had but which don't seem to fit the Travel Experience categories. Qantas has a great premium economy product: very good food and wines and generally excellent service in this part of the cabin. However on this set of flights I had unhappy experiences: for SYD- HKG I did not get my usual window seat preference even though I am a platinum frequent flyer. This is sort of ok but after take off I was asked to swap seats with someone who couldn't get his IFE to work which I was pleased to do but then found myself surrounded by a bunch of passengers who were it seems trying to drink as much alcohol as possible and who invited their mates up from the back of the plane to join in the party which generally took place in the isles or at the front of this cabin. This made for a terrible flight experience as one could neither work nor sleep due to the loud talking and calls for more drinks - which I was slightly surprised to see Qantas staff obligingly provided. On the return travel the staff at the boarding gate insisted on changing my boarding pass to give me one for someone of another name (it was a woman's name as well and I am not a woman) and then arguing with me that this other passenger was me! A bizarre and embarrassing experience to say the least especially as this also held up the boarding process for some time with other passengers glaring at me as if it was all my fault. My guess is that this boarding pass was for a woman who they had given my original seat to. Thankfully the situation was sorted out by a senior staff member as it turned out I was to be provided with a business upgrade - which was excellent.,0,5,Roger Stone,2013-10-29,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,4,Qantas Airways
Qantas Airways customer review,Old faithful. SYD-MEL-SYD 24/25 October B767. Great Service on a comfortable if rattly business class seat. Compared to the current dreadful A330 business seat to Perth that I'm dreading to have to sit in for 5 hours in a few days time I'd happily have the old seat any day.

The trip over was great but on the return I had a person in front who had his seat fully reclined I was unable to even bend over as there was so little room.

The staff were professional relaxed and very accommodating not only to us but to passengers around us. The cabin was clean well equipped with blankets etc for our long trip. The entertainment devices worked well. Most of all I felt the little extra touches made the trip more comfortable - bottles of water without needing to request water extra snacks in case of ""the munchies"" during the night or other than mealtimes.
