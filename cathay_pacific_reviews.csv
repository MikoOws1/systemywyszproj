I was told that I could get on the earlier flight departing in 40 minutes. No notification from CX received about this; which is unusual for Cathay. I had to run to the gate to catch my flight. No chance to go the lounge for breakfast as planned. Since I got the last seat, random middle seat assigned. Flight was uneventful and on time. The next flight to Chengdu was a CX flight number operated by Air China, therefore no benefits received such as seat selection or lounge access.

"""have to serve one customer at a time""","During a recent flight with Cathay Pacific in business class, while seated by the window, I observed that other passengers were being served breakfast, some even finishing their meals, while I remained unattended. I had ordered a simple breakfast with no special requests, and the delay felt significant. When I inquired about my meal, the flight attendant responded in a manner I considered less than courteous, simply stating, 'We have to serve one customer at a time'. This was the only breakfast I ordered during a 12-hour flight before landing. I am unsure whether my feelings are justified or if I am being overly sensitive. However, after being a loyal business class customer for over 10 years, I am considering alternative airlines for future travel.

"""worst Business Class experience ever""","Cathay Pacific should be renamed Cathay Pathetic. Business Class Tokyo to Hong Kong. The seats are the worst and most uncomfortable I have ever experienced in this class. I asked for a blanket as it was freezing, and the pathetic rag of cloth they gave me was as thin as a tea towel. Worse still, I have another flight with them in 7 hours. I am on the aircraft writing this review. After the next flight, I will never use them again. Now, after arrival in Hong Kong, I discovered that the Business Class lounge is closed, and no other lounges are open. It’s a total disgrace to pay many times more for Business Class and receive economy-class service. Of course, not a word about it when you book the ticket. This truly is the worst Business Class experience ever.

"""economy seat was horribly uncomfortable""","I have always enjoyed flying the A350 on other airlines. The economy seat on this CX flight was horribly uncomfortable. Absolutely no back support. Even with the cushion I requested, my back was still curved. Since the aircraft had four classes, I assume it is also used on long haul flights. I could never sit for even a few hours on this seat. Most other aspects of the flight were fine, apart from the fact that none of the FAs smiled - until we deplaned. I fully appreciate that CX went through a really bad time during the covid epidemic and getting back up to speed takes time, especially with the need to train new staff. But surely smiling at passengers is one of the first parts of training - and the easiest!",1,4,John Duffus,2024-12-15,no,Economy Class,Business,Bangkok to Hong Kong,December 2024,1,3,5,2,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

“cabin crew politely declined my request”,"I understand that it was an inconvenient time for my son to use the restroom during meal service. I considered returning his food tray to the nearest cabin crew so I could hold onto mine and allow my son to go to the restroom. However, the cabin crew explained there was no space for tray as he politely declined my request. Fortunately, the passenger next to me kindly made room, understanding the situation, and I was able to pass the tray to my husband, who was sitting in front of us. As my son returned, the same cabin crew asked him to wait at the side, as there was limited space for him to go through. I was fine with that until another cabin crew then suggested they reverse by a step since our seats were right next to the trolley. Such a simple initiative comes from a genuinely helpful attitude. And a helping hand with the tray for like 10 seconds and then returned to me as soon as my son made his way out from the seats would be nice. But then of course due to this incident I might not choose window seats for my children in the future — window view vs. helpfulness of cabin crew making way for bathroom visits, I have to forgo the view.",1,8,L Wong,2024-12-11,yes,Economy Class,Family Leisure,Hong Kong to Singapore,December 2024,5,3,5,3,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

"""an outstanding representative""","My review is very specific to the Cathay Pacific ground staff at Schipol Airport, who were very extraordinary and creative in the way they tried to solve our issue. My wife's ticket was categorised as a 'staff ticket' whilst mine was regular. The flight was full with about six other Stand-Bys. We have a Qantas flight back to Sydney to get onto in Hong Kong after landing so it was paramount we get there in the next 24 hours. Without promises nor treating us any more special than others, Joel advised of other routes we could take; via Zurich, via Guangzhou, via London and those available from other airlines. Fortuitously I could not purchase tickets on any of the options so he advised us to take a chance and hope for no-shows. Two hours on the edge was rewarded with two seats on the plane at the very last second! Not only that, he managed to have us seated close enough to each other that I can hold the wife's hand who's a nervous flyer. Joel, your name and face is forever etched in our memories and we have since developed a fondness and a sense of loyalty to Cathay Pacific. Thanks to you and your team for getting us on our way safely home.

Seats are still too close together, so from a window seat, others have to vacate to let you in and out. In the last row of course the meal options are no longer available and although this didn't bother me, other guests complained that this always happens. Cabin crew apologised and said that although they include this ongoing problem in their reports, the company changes nothing. They suggested instead that guests complain directly to Cathay.

"""forced to purchase a new return ticket""","I had an incredibly frustrating experience traveling from Singapore to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific, which turned out to be the worst experience I've ever had. Firstly, Cathay has no ground staff support for customers needing to change or rebook flights at Hong Kong and Singapore airports. When I missed my flight from Singapore to Hong Kong, the ground staff redirected me to the customer call center, adding to the frustration. To make matters worse, they provided me with the wrong contact number, forcing me to hunt for the correct one. The customer center's assistance was lackluster, providing little essential information and prompting me to purchase new tickets online in a rush, following their instructions.  I usually choose full-service carriers and pay premium prices directly on their official websites expecting better support during unexpected situations. However, with Cathay, that expectation was shattered, leaving me to handle everything as if I were flying budget. Additionally, during my attempts to change my flight, I wasn't provided with accurate information by Cathay. I was blindsided by the cancellation of my return ticket from Hong Kong to Singapore. Despite my intentions to rebook clearly communicated to the customer center, they failed to inform me of the cancellation or take any proactive measures. I received no notification via email or phone call regarding this significant change. Discovering my canceled ticket upon arriving at the airport left me helpless, with no ground staff available to assist and another call to the customer center proving unfruitful. I was forced to purchase a new return ticket at an exorbitant last-minute price. Cathay should have retained my return ticket given my clear communication and willingness to pay the hefty last-minute fees, or notified me of the cancellation promptly. Instead, the whole experience felt like dealing with impersonal automated systems.",1,1,N Chong,2024-05-07,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,Hong Kong to Singapore,May 2024,3,3,1,3,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
"""unsatisfactory travel experience""",Overall an unsatisfactory travel experience. Mainly because of the poor on time performance and recovery services handling.

“I find it very underwhelming”,"Plane was dated. There is only one USB available for charging. In flight entertainment is pretty limited, even TV series are old series and only have like 6 episodes. Service wise is very lacking taking into consideration that it is a business class seat. Firstly, flight manager is selective on whom he greets on the plane. Does not greet everyone on the plane. Happened to the unlucky one he chose to ignore. From where I am seated, he greeted passengers around me (including the passenger behind that came in late) but he deliberately skipped me for reasons unknown. When I checked if I had offended him, no apologies but just accused me of being sensitive and make a lot of noise to embarrass me. In addition, I had requested for meals to be served just before landing as I just had a meal in the lounge, service crew insist that I need to have the meal after take off. After the meal I still have 3 hours to landing. The service crew were also not very “present” in the flight as they do not continuously go around ensuring that everyone’s drinks are filled. The moment you finish your drink, they clear it and no offer to provide more drinks unless you request.

Fabulous attentive service and the best food I've seen on a CX flight since before Covid - really nice beef. Good drinks choice. Arriving in HK and the Neos apparently land at the new terminal across the sky bridge, quite a journey to the terminal up and down escalators. The seats were brand new in economy and looked good.

In addition to the attitude of the flight attendants, my meals were really perfunctory and unpalatable, and the Häagen-Dazs at 3:00 in the middle of the night was also a very amazing arrangement.

He came to passengers in my area to ask if they enjoyed their meals, make sure they're okay, and chatted with them. Cathay Pacific's in flight entertainment option is the best curated and has the latest films and TV series. However their in flight entertainment option is inconsistent, it depends on the type of aircraft or route you are flying. What Cathay Pacific could improve on is their meal service.

“Shame on you Cathay Pacific!”,"Shameful exploitation. As a seasoned world traveller, I have flown with pretty much all of the main carriers, and I’m pretty sure I flew with Cathay Pacific around 23 years ago to Singapore. So for my upcoming trip to Phuket via Hong Kong we chose to fly with them again (not much choice to be honest!). Having paid a considerable amount of money to fly with Cathay Pacific this time around, I was horrified and extremely disappointed that to reserve seats so that my wife and I could sit together on the 4 flights I had to pay £197.60. This is absolutely daylight robbery! How can they justify this much money for reserving 2 seats! It costs them nothing… they have already taken 1000’s of pounds for my flights and there is no additional administration needed because its all done via computer (if fact I received confirmation of my reserved seats straight after I’d paid the additional £197.60). It seems to me that they are exploiting a captive audience and playing on the fear of their travellers not being able to sit together on these long haul flights. Shame on you Cathay Pacific! This will be the last time I ever fly with CP, and I will make it my mission in life to inform my many 1000’s of contacts worldwide to do the same! Note: The date of my flight is the 5th of March 2024, so that I could leave this review I chose todays date.",1,1,Brian Pell,2023-12-15,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,London Heathrow to Puket via Hong Kong,December 2023,3,N/A,3,3,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
"""the worst airline experience""","I recently had the misfortune of booking a flight with Cathay Pacific, and I must say it was the worst airline experience of my life. From start to finish, everything about this trip left me questioning why anyone would willingly subject themselves to such a miserable ordeal. Let's begin with the booking process, which was a nightmare in itself. The website is a convoluted mess, reminiscent of the early days of the internet. Trying to navigate through the various options and actually find a reasonable flight was like solving a complex puzzle. It's 2023, and Cathay Pacific's website seems stuck in the dark ages of web design. Once the day of my flight finally arrived, any hope for redemption was swiftly crushed. The check-in process was an exercise in frustration, with interminable lines and disinterested staff who seemed more interested in their own conversations than assisting passengers. It was as if they were doing me a favor by allowing me to board their subpar aircraft. The interior looked worn out,  seats were uncomfortable, with minimal legroom. The in-flight entertainment system was a relic from a bygone era, offering a limited selection of outdated movies and glitchy games. The food served to me was inedible. But the pièce de résistance of this disastrous trip was the customer service—or lack thereof. The flight attendants seemed to have perfected the art of indifference. Requests for assistance were met with eye rolls and sighs, as if I were inconveniencing them by expecting basic courtesy. It was abundantly clear that the concept of customer satisfaction was lost on the Cathay Pacific crew. To add insult to injury, my luggage was mishandled, arriving at my destination battered and bruised.  My belongings were in shambles, and the airline's response was a lackluster apology that did nothing to remedy the situation. In conclusion, my experience with Cathay Pacific was an unmitigated disaster.",0,1,Paul Pellegrino,2023-11-30,no,Economy Class,Business,London to Hong Kong,October 2023,1,1,1,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways

"""airline offered me no compensation""","I recently had a disheartening experience while traveling with Cathay Pacific on a connecting flight from Chicago to Mumbai via Hong Kong. Unfortunately, my baggage did not make it onto the connecting flight, leading to a series of inconveniences and frustrations. At Chicago, I was assured that my baggage would be seamlessly transferred to my final destination in Mumbai. However, upon reaching Mumbai and waiting at the baggage carousel, it became apparent that one out of my 4 luggage went missing. The entire ordeal left me deeply dissatisfied with the airline's handling of the situation. The consequences of this mishap were significant. Not having access to my checked baggage caused delays and disruptions to my plans. I had to spend valuable time at Mumbai Airport with my 6 month old infant who already flew for 24+ hours, filling out a lost baggage report and providing detailed information about the contents of my missing suitcase, taking all my baggage to customs and loading/unloading all bags at their counters. This process added unnecessary stress and frustration to an otherwise smooth journey. What further exacerbated the situation was the lack of clear communication from airline representatives at BOM. Despite inquiring about the status of my baggage, I was asked to check and recheck the conveyer belt, After a frustrating two hours with my six-month-old baby, they finally admitted that they had received information that my bag had not been loaded at HKG. They continued to blame HKG staff and demanded that I complete all formalities without offering an apology, even though I had inquired about the status of my baggage.  In hindsight, I believe there is a need for improved coordination between airports and airlines, especially during transit. The reliability of baggage handling is a fundamental aspect of air travel, and passengers should be able to trust that their belongings will reach the final destination without complications. Human error happens, but how you handle a situation like this one makes all the difference. Rather than wasting my 2.5 hours, they could have told me that this happened and that they are sorry about it but assured me that they are on top of things, and I wouldn't have been this frustrated. After all, they had already received an email about my missing bag. After spending two hours at the airport completing all the processes, I finally received my suitcase five days later (I had to buy some new goods due to the delay). The airline offered me no compensation and not even an apology. Regarding my travel, it was very pleasant and comfortable, not a single issue but would avoid Cathay in future because of such frustrating customer service I hope that my feedback can be taken into consideration for the improvement of the airline's baggage handling procedures. Travelers should feel confident that their luggage will be handled with care and arrive at their intended destination as promised.",1,2,Mayur Danekar,2023-11-27,no,Economy Class,Family Leisure,Chicago to Mumbai via Hong Kong,November 2023,4,4,1,4,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

The staff at the JFK Counter is clueless, not polite and not helpful. They kept giving wrong information, seems like they need more internal training. and they told me there is no line on the regular security check, and I was on the line for 1 hour just because their system can’t find my TNT number, unbelievable.

CX216 from Manchester to Hong Kong on A350 aircraft was average, The seats in economy are narrow but do have decent legroom.

Cabin Crew were fairly efficient when providing food or drinks to the full cabin but otherwise absent outside these times. Food average and choices limited. CX163 Hong Kong to Melbourne was B777 in premium economy. The flight was announced as delayed once passengers were at the gate. A delay of 45 minutes was never readdressed and the eventual delay was over 90 minutes with no information provided. The plane was in need of a major refurbishment stained seats and broken meal trays were much in evidence. The sound system was very poor. Cabin service was poor and the food below average.

IFE is great, there is such a selection of movies that kept me awake. I saw 3 movies during the 11 hour 40 min. flight. I just had a little nap; during flight you can have a snack at the galley at rear of plane. WC is typical but there is cologne and hand cream.

I could not move around at all, nor access my personal bag, I had to have the guy next to me reach down to get my things, and I'm not overweight or anything, you just have no room to maneuver. I avoided reclining my seat fully to not spread the joy, and it was fine at partial recline for me. Just excessive for standard economy with limited pitch. Also the screen turns on when brushed against, so I was constantly having to turn it off again when moving around because there was about 12in of space between my face and it - at least a dozen probably two dozen instances. The guy next to me had the same issue I noticed. At least they had a lot of good options for entertainment, just I didn't use it and the screen was endlessly an issue. Food was mediocre, and nowhere near enough for 13 hours. Another airline I'm surprised has gotten a ""top globally"" label.

When I approached a CX supervisor at London airport, she told me that even a ticket issue by CX, all the fault and responsibility lies with BA, so CX cannot offer any help.

"""the most disappointing flight experience""","After paying over £3200 for the ticket, Cathay Pacific proved to be the most disappointing flight experience I have had in a number of years. The premium economy cabin on my flights was shabby and old - and while economy, business and first had all been upgraded, Premium Economy was tired, shabby and underwhelming. Service, in general, was brisk and unfriendly. The meal service lacking and with no great differentiation to the economy offering. They had printed menus but I don't know why they bothered as some of food choices were not available and of three white wines listed, only one was available. The cabin was filthy and by the end of the flight it looked like a rubbish tip. The IFE was particularly bad and poorly designed with an unresponsive touch screen and frustrating functions. I remember fondly the days of travelling with Cathay and it being a special and memorable experience. Now it feels like Cathay is barely hanging on the the lowest standards of service, comfort and quality. This is an airline I never choose to travel with again. Cathay hands down have the best lounges I have ever been to, but here the quality stops and by the time you get on board and have been ignored and dismissed by their often rude crew, you realise that you're paying top price to sit on a budget carrier in all other respects.

The food and drink were acceptable, if unexciting, and the seats were comfortable. But the absence of any sort of privacy screens was surprising and felt dated. All the flight attendants were extraordinarily prompt at responding to requests for service and appeared willing. I had two main issues. On the flight from Auckland to Hong Kong (11-1/2 hours, 38 seats in business, I think) there was no Champagne available after takeoff. A flight attendant told me they had only loaded three bottles, which ran out on the ground. The flight was late into Hong Kong, so I was transferred to a later flight on which I was assigned (without warning or apology) a middle seat, instead of the window I'd reserved. The absence of any privacy screen meant I spent a rather intimate 13+ hours with a stranger. He was a nice chap, but if I want a blind date, I'll go online rather than on an aircraft. I paid £5,000+ for business because I wanted Champane and privacy, so I am not too happy. Anyways, I've asked for a partial refund and was going to await a response from Cathay before posting. But Cathay has just responded: ""A member of our Customer Care team will review your case and respond in approximately six weeks’ time.""

I did not see the Y class menu, but it looked like average economy class food on China. An example were the what the menu pompously called “a variety of cereals”, when I asked what the choices were, I was handed a small box of Kellogg’s cornflakes. So there was no variety. The same applies to wine. There is no more choice, just one white or one red, which were both dreadful.

And when the plane had arrived in Sydney, and all the passengers were waiting for their bags, a series of announcements were made to say that all the bags were still inside the plane’s hold, and the airline did not know when they would be released.

The 15-hour flight between Hong Kong and Toronto was better than in 2019, thanks to a new A350-1000 aircraft. However, there are still only two meal services on this very long flight, which is not enough. There really needs to be a third service with a proper snack box at the very least.

"""We will never book with Cathay again""","We booked our flight from Toronto to Auckland on Cathay. Not an efficient route, but the fare was better than other routings and we have always appreciated the inflight service. Things went OK on the outbound flight although they rescheduled our flight several times. At least they notified us of the changes, Three days before our return flight, I went on line to check our departure time and there was a notice that our flights had been cancelled. They did not advise us, they did not try to rebook us. There was an option to click a button and request a refund only. In a panic, I called the NZ number on their website and got a message that the number was not in service. The only way I could communicate was a What’s App chat. After hours on this chat, the agent offered me a routing through New York which would get us home two days later than planned. Not great, but better than nothing. I said I would take it upon which she said it was not really available because the last leg was on American Airlines and they would need approval. She said my only option was to depart four days later on the original routing. I told her our visa expired on the original date and she said this was not Cathay’s problem. Mercifully, her shift ended and I got shunted to a new agent who was willing to try and get us on the JFK flight. She said I would have to wait for email confirmation. After an agonizing day of waiting for this confirmation, I went on line and saw that the American flight was confirmed but that the two Cathay flights were waitlisted! Back to the chat and more hours wasted to get all flights confirmed.

For short to medium haul, this is quite acceptable. In March 2023, post pandemic time, mask is no longer mandatory. Cathay once again introduces hot towels, and meals served in separate courses. Only things absent were inflight magazines, duty free catalogues and on board duty free sales. Other than that, it's business as usual. Meals were nicely presented in simple but chic white porcelain wares, with 3 mains to choose from. Our cabin was full for the day and 4 crew worked diligently to make sure everyone is happy. The flight itself was uneventful and very relaxing. I have now regained confidence with CX, and will be happy to fly with them wherever I go.

"""a huge step above the economy class seats""","Hong Kong's strict quarantine procedure has been lifted and flights between Hong Kong and America are resuming gradually, so me and my family decided to fly to New York for vacation. Cathay Pacific was extremely thorough with its check-in procedures. At the beginning, all passengers will have to line up to have their body temperature checked before being able to get into one of the baggage check-in isles. I was flying premium economy and I had to stay with the economy class line. Fortunately thanks to the world class efficiency of the Cathay Pacific baggage check-in staffs, I did not have to wait too turn to have my turn. Check-in staff has kindly asked to check all my identifications and itinerary. Despite I was flying premium economy class, I was able to access and enjoy the Cathay Lounge in Hong Kong with my credit card. The lounge is simply top notch. Boarding was on schedule. There was a slight but acceptable waiting time at the taxiway due to the traffic. The flight was operated with a B777-300 with 34 seats in premium economy class configured 2x4x2. Half of the seats were occupied. On boarding I was offered a drink and asked for the specifically non-alcoholic mixed drink that Cathay Pacific always offers. In addition to that, the cabin crew also offered me a hot towel to clean up my hands before enjoying the welcome drink and all the facilities around my seat. A care kit was at each seat with a disposable mask and a few sheets of antiseptic wipes. The Cathay Pacific premium economy class seats are quite well designed to take advantage of the available space. It was surprisingly comfortable and a huge step above the economy class seats. For those who want a little more seat comfort, you should pay the extra bucks for upgrading to the premium economy seats! I have been flying Cathay Pacific for many years and I have seen the ranking of Cathay Pacific has been dropping significantly and people were talking about the deterioration of the service and cabin quality as opposed to other Asian airline counterparts. It was sad to hear because my satisfactory experience with Cathay Pacific has always been consistent and I don't notice any deterioration of the service and cabin quality. Cathay Pacific definitely deserves better. Last but not least, I recommend everyone to fly with Cathay Pacific Airways, whether long haul or short haul flight.

"""This was an appalling experience""","This was an appalling experience. We were on a code share flight, starting in Auckland with an Air New Zealand flight to Hong Kong. We travelled business class and the Air NZ service was exemplary. By contrast, the Cathay cabin crew were a shambles and gave no customer service. They stood around with a tray of drinks as we boarded but did not offer them. The menu was disappointing and the cabin crew so badly organised that it took ages for them to serve the food. I chose fish which was fairly revolting. My wife opted for the vegetarian dish which arrived half an hour after everybody else had been served and was inedible. There was no attempt to see if we were ok or wanted another drink or coffee. I gave my breakfast order before going to sleep. My wife was not asked for her order with the result that they claimed not to have her choice (they later managed to find it). I was served the wrong breakfast and again had to ask for everything - more coffee etc. The crew seemed completely disinterested in their passengers. On a 14 hour flight the restrooms became insanitary but the crew paid no attention to them until we asked for them to be cleaned. The lack of service would have been unsatisfactory in economy class; it was unacceptable for business class.",1,1,Ray Kipling,2023-01-20,no,Business Class,Couple Leisure,Hong Kong to London,January 2023,4,1,1,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
"""Still a reliable airline""","The online side of CX is still very slick and easy to use. Lounge at HK gate 40 has a good food and drink selection. Boarding smooth. As its a late departure a rather odd choice of food on offer and a bit of a rushed feel to the service. Some items like salt and pepper had to be asked for. Drinks flowing, Riesling is excellent. Return was again a late flight. Lounge at LAX is huge but food offering dismal. Really cheap looking. CX need to look into this. I wouldn't rush there. Boarding all good and the kind staff found an item I had left at check in- thank you !! Food choices better and service good. Seat set up is great, everything technically perfect. Lovely breakfast and asked for champagne with- no problem! Arrived an hour early. Airport back to normal finally and home by 0745am.

They provide WhatsApp customer service which takes so long to respond and you change so many agent for a simple enquiry. (Normally 4-5 days for a simple enquiry). They promise Asian refund over booking cancellation but when you rebook they took no responsibility with the refund. They had my chat details through WhatsApp chat proofing the return of the mileage confirmed by staff and they simply apologised for their mistake and took no action.

"""Worst customer service ever""","Every aspect of my first (and last) experience with Cathay Pacific has been a nightmare. Firstly they cancelled and automatically rebooked me on flights which didn't match up (the connecting flight leaving before the inbound one landing) and it took a whole month of emails to rectify. I was asked to register details for priority check in 48 hours before boarding, and this automatically triggered a move for the booking from my BA account to their AsiaMiles account (which I am still trying to rectify, with zero replies from Cathay). Despite me meticulously adding my BA number to the booking. They then lost my luggage and what was going to be a 24 hour delay turned into a four day wait (my bags went on a grand tour Amsterdam>Istanbul>Hong Kong>Melbourne). The AU$150 given to me initially provided essentials for the first day in Melbourne, and I was assured I'd by someone managing baggage loss that I'd be reimbursed for any other essentials. Which came to just over £200. On providing receipts I was offered AU$50 because the items bought will have ""residual value"" (I mean – they can have these items sent to them if they like! I just wanted my baggage). Through all of the above, I have tried to use the WhatsApp customer service they advertise which is utterly, utterly pointless. It takes 24 hours for someone to reply with: ""you must be busy now, please contact us again if you need help"", as if you're monitoring your WhatsApp 24/7. I have an archive of around 150 curtailed WhatsApp chats.

This is instrumental to a long flight (>14 hours) as you don’t want to feel stuffed but refreshed and hydrated. The flight is clean and seats feel very new (not sure if they did any renovation during the pandemic). The ground service of CX at the Logan airport is great.

"""It has been a nightmare""","Paid extra for a good seat; Didn't get it due to weight balance but was promised refund the price difference before the flight; Wasted 10+ hours in nightmares with the Cathay Pacific customer service on whatsapp, emails, and phone calls, but it's still not resolved yet. I spent a few hundred dollars more on this 17 hour long trip, for a seat with good leg room and unobstructed view by the wing. However, I was told by the lady at the check-in counter that the seat had been changed by ""the people in Hong Kong"" for weight balance and she could do nothing about it. But she told me that the price difference can be refunded as long as I contact the customer service. And I believed her easily and thought that would be easy and not waste much of my time, because the fact that a paid service cannot be provided implies that that part of the cost should refunded. Or so I thought. The first customer service guy told me that it was impossible even before I could finish describing my situation. And he was also very ignorant of what services they are offering, and thought that one doesn't have to pay anything for extra leg room nowadays. I contacted again in emails, and the second person turned out to be a huge disappointment too. I was humiliated by a ""goodwill gesture"" of 10,000 Asia Miles that I will probably never use. And this guy even started to blame that it was their staff at JFK who changed my seat, which contradicted what I heard before the flight. And I am confused why that can be a good reason for not refunding me too, maybe by discrediting the check-in counter lady who told me that I could easily get a refund? After that I have spent more hours on emails and phone calls with their customer service. It has been a nightmare. More appointment and more humiliation. This is my first flight with Cathay Pacific, and I think the last one too. I don't know why it was a trustworthy airline in my impression, but not anymore. Regarding the inflight experience, I had a broken TV, a tiny unstable table with no beverage holder, and was in a location directly facing the toilet.

"""refund/compensation policy makes no sense""","All my flights from Canada to Vietnam were canceled a month or two before my trip so I called them to reschedule the flights. It took them forever to confirm my new flights and send me a new itinerary. I had to call them again 1-2 weeks before the trip to ask for an update and even then, not all of reservations were confirmed. My flight from Saskatoon to Vancouver apparently needed an update from the Hong Kong team who needed to connect with Air Canada. That again took extremely long. I had to call them almost every single day to ask about the flight just to get the same response of ""Don't worry, you are assured to get on the flight"" or ""We still need to her back from the Hong Kong Team"" or ""We will call you as soon as we have any update"". Up until 3 days before the trip, I did not receive a single call or email regarding the issue. On that day, I had to call them constantly for 5 hours, talking to numerous agents without being to make any progress. And, at the last minute, they informed me that the flight was no longer in their system. Apparently, Air Canada decided to prioritize their passengers and I couldn't get on the flight anymore despite having requested it months ago. This miscommunication between airlines COST ME $600 to book myself a last-minute flight with another airline (Westjet) from Saskatoon to Vancouver to catch other flights. That was the cheapest ticket I could find which unfortunately left a day early than my planned trip. So I had to stay at the Vancouver airport more than 24 hours. And since it was too sudden, I could not make any hotel reservations and had to sleep on a wooden bench in a food court where people talked throughout the night. Also, due to the small number of Cathay Pacific flights from Vancouver to anywhere else, there was not a single agent I could talk to in person. I couldn't even check in my luggage early and had to sleep with two 23-kg boxes and 2 extra carry ons. I was extremely disappointed with Cathay Pacific. Initially, I thought their customer service was good as they were nice and tried to book new flights for me when I requested. But, their inability to communicate with other airlines or even among their teams slowed everything to an extreme. To make it even worse, their refund/compensation policy makes no sense. They couldn't fly me out to Vancouver but they reused to give me a refund for that particular flight. They told me that if I wanted a refund, I would need to cancel the trip for a complete refund. Now, I don't know who I talk to about this issue to demand a fair explanation and compensation.

"""deterioration of business class food and wine""","While there was a direct SYD-SFO option with UA, their price for business class was excessive and my track record with UA in flight service isn't great. So I opted for the indirect SYD-HKG-SFO routing at a much more palatable price that also helped with my oneworld status. The check-in staff in SYD were great and then immigration and security were empty and I was through to airside in no time. Of course, with essentially everything closed at SYD including all the lounges, there was nothing much to do. Boarding was swift and we were on our way to HKG in no time. Security at HKG was also empty however fortunately CX's Wing lounge was open. After the mandatory additional security checks at the gate, boarding for the SFO sector was also swift. I can only say that the Cathay crew on both sectors were outstanding, much like the days of yore when Cathay was one of the world's greatest airlines. Courteous, caring and personable, they seemed to want to go the extra mile to ensure everyone was as comfortable as possible. If this review were just about the inflight crew then they'd get top marks however what drags down the experience is the continued deterioration of the CX business class food and wine offering. Most of what I consumed was average at best although the most surprising thing was that a salad that was listed both as a supper option and then again as an ""anytime"" option, only had one serving loaded for maybe 15 business class passengers. The crew were mortified but could do nothing. I realise things are tough for CX at the moment but why tantalise premium passengers with an extensive menu if you can't deliver on it?

"""No apologies, no compensation, nothing""","Of 4 airlines that I booked for my wife and myself to LAX from MNL, Cathay Pacific was the only not to cancel our outbound flight.

They were content to strand her in HKG. When I called, they offered the same itinerary that my wife already had on a different date. But they wanted an upcharge of over $1,000. They finally booked on an itinerary with a 12 hour transit in HKG. No apologies, no compensation, nothing. My wife had to accept as she had to be in MNL for a work deadline. Days after, I received an email that my return flight was changed. Upon closer examination, I realized that CX stuck me with a 24.5 hour layover in HKG. Their attitude was that I accepted the change. I did not. They made the change, not me. I found out that under HK law, I'm not even allowed to have a transit that long! Not sure what CX was planning to do with me after I was denied transit in HKG. When I called, I was offered my previous itinerary on a different date but with a $2200 upcharge.

"""I won't recommend Cathay to anyone""","The review is to do with Cathay's customer service (CS) attitude and its business ethic during the COVID crisis. They lied and refused to help those who are in vulnerable situations. 12 Jul, I booked for 9 Aug flights 14 Jul, Australia drops incoming travellers quota further. Every week I would check with Cathay if I could still get to fly - its CS told me I was fine. I have also indicated that I'm on my 3rd trimester. I would be 33-week pregnant by the time I fly. Shockingly, Cathay only emailed me 3 days before the flight date with lies that flight got cancelled. Never got a phone call. Never got offered replacement seats. I knew the flight cancellation was a lie because my mum was still got her seat on the same flight. We book our flight together but because my mum was on a business seat, Cathay split her booking ID from mine. My mother is disabled and I'm her sole carer in Australia so this outcome was the worst. Because I would be stuck alone in Thailand giving birth without close family and Mum would also be struck alone in Sydney's quarantine and she could barely speak English. From Friday 7 to Sunday 9 of August, I chatted to Cathay's CS and called them over 5 times. They all said sorry but it was up to the ""Revenue team"" to review my case. I was surprised that the authority of this matter is in the hand of the revenue team which probably doesn't work on the weekend. After the first request, all I got is one cold rejected email on Sat morning. The CS said the earliest next flight for me is 2 September, way pass my 36-week of pregnancy (you aren't allowed to fly after). This is either a lie or an act of negligent. From social media, I found out later that other Cathay passengers who got bumped off their flights after my case got offered flights much earlier than this, even as early as 11 August. I relentlessly politely appealed to the CS and begged for their help and offers them many options they can do for us - 1) Reinstate my seat; 2) Allow me to take my mum place to fly (she can be cared for in Thailand while waiting for her next flight) and; 3) Refund both of our flights so we have our fund to try to fly elsewhere.

"""many touch points missed""","Los Angeles to Bangkok via Hong Kong. Travel is a gift. Every touch point should evoke a different sense of excitement and thrill. Air flights are the beginnings of many touch points, and options for comfort exist. International business class is not all equal. Here's my optic of Cathay Pacific Business Class LAX-HKG-BKK and the return BKK-HKG-LAX. How excited we were to by chance be able to save our vacation travel from headaches and fly Cathay Pacific. Originally, we were set to fly PAL Business Class thru Manila to BKK; however, the Taal Volcano threw us a curve ball four days before our journey was to begin. In desperately search for an alternative carrier that would align with existing connections in BKK as well as return accommodation in BKK, Cathay Pacific held the flights. Without hesitation we booked. Now, we are not novices to International Business Class travel. EVA is our most preferred carrier, but its flight schedule did not align with our awaiting connection in BKK. We had always said that we should fly Cathay Pacific to see how it compared. It was only just nine months earlier we flew PAL for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. With that being said, we were under impression that Cathay Pacific held one up on EVA. So, perhaps Cathay Pacific would be our new go to first before EVA. Let us begin. Flight CX881 15 Jan 20 LAX-HKG departed on time. That's always a good thing. The business seat though lacks lumbar support (see photo). The amenity kit was marginally stocked with a toothbrush kit, 15ml mouthwash, Bamford hand cream plus lip balm as well as hydrating face spray, sleep mask, and earplugs. Other marginal amenities were a pair of small disposal slippers that are not quite sized to accommodate a wide foot market and a comforter. No pajamas here folks on this long haul as EVA, but to be fair PAL lacks PJs as well. Good thing though I brought a heavy cotton sweater as the cabin is kept cold, like cold cold. You learn these little things as you travel. Not all carriers maintain comfortable air. Movie selection at first appears to be vast, but upon further review, Maleficent was the only recent movie. I'm not on top of trending movies, so I named Maleficent due to TV commercial exposure. The rest are older releases with some that are ancient. Ah, not something expected. Please take time to learn what customers are seeing at the movies. A note about the interactive monitor, it is sluggish to the point of freezing up at times while scrolling. What type of dated software operating system is being used? Just saying. The dinner options were typical. Local food with some Western. When the flight attendant came to take my dinner order, she asked if I would like the burger. She then asked if I would like the seared chicken breast. That received a no. She actually looks stunned and finally asked what I would like. I ordered fish ball tung choy choy soup. For beverages, I ordered French Burgundy and water. BTW, no flight attendant comes around asking if you would like more wine.  Dessert taken was cheese along with fruit, and I asked for a cordial Cointreau. Another look of like OMG I have to work. With the flight leaving almost at midnight, there was no pre cordial anything which was not expected either. So many touch points missed.

The onboard FA's never welcomed us properly, didn't ask for our coats to be hung. The Flight manager came once introducing herself and we never saw her again. The crew were just pacing up and down the aisle and never once smiled. They continued with one of the worst meal offerings. The meals on a set menu weren't dine anytime options, they were pre packaged and felt the same offerings were being presented to economy class passengers. The bread tasted like it was transported from 4 flights before. It wasn't surprising to see how much Cathay had declined in the reviews. Currently, they sit at the bottom among 10 best airlines in some websites and much lower in others. It's sad to see that a premier airlines can't get the basics right. Perhaps, the can take a leaf from ANA and Singapore airlines hospitality. We flew Singapore economy on short haul flights and their service was next to superb with so much attention to details in economy! The positives at Cathay were their beds and on board IFE.

Meal service was wonderful, staff taking your orders on a tablet before bringing food to your seat without a trolley. I never thought a hamburger on a plane could be so good but they managed to do it very well, the only downside was the chips which were below average. Drinks were nice, and the champagne upon boarding is a lovely touch. The flatbed seat was really comfortable and I managed to sleep quite well. The lounges at Hong Kong were incredible, and I made a point of visiting several. Highlights include the tea room where you can have your choice of tea brewed in a very spacious and tranquil room. The shower rooms were spacious. Service at the bar was great. The only disappointing thing at the lounge was the noodle bar which really didn't do much for me despite yum cha and noodle soup you can expect all over Hong Kong. They even have a meditation corner which was a nice way to relax. The egg tarts were okay, but nothing to write home about. Can't really comment on value for money as this was a points redemption, however, I generally find the cost difference between economy and business is much better spent on the ground at your destination. My only complaint was that my bag was mishandled and delayed as a result. It was handled so poorly that both the check-in bag tag, and a personal tag on mine were missing from the bag.

Finally, we got in the plane by 5 am, after almost 1 hour waiting inside the aircraft the pilot informs that, due to technical issues, the engineers are not able to fix the problem and we have to get off the plane. They re-scheduled the flight and the departure was to take part at 11 am - almost 12 hours delay. they new about these technical issues from the beginning, however, they decided to keep us waiting all night without proper rest, pending on news that we never got.

Cathay fly to places one actually needs to get to, in my case, Zurich. All flights on-time or very early. All food options good. Quality service from a very attentive cabin crew on all flights. As a One World Emerald member I had access to the superb Qantas First Lounge in Melbourne and, of course, various Cathay First Class Lounge offerings in Hong Kong. Cathay also uses the Aspire First Lounge in Zurich and this is quite superb. My only gripe is the on-board IFE - I never find anything worthwhile to watch, except the live News Streaming - but that often doesn't seem to be in range.

"""revamped First is disappointing""","Hong Kong to London. Check in was a breeze at the City Centre in Hong Kong, and staff was friendly. The lounges were the highlight, with massage, private day room, and the Cabana was beautiful with its own bath and daybed. The lounge food was satisfactory. However in comparison with Lufthansa first class terminal, the food was pretty subpar. There was no private transfer of course from the lounge to the plane either. For the flight itself, there was no accompaniment to the seat, just a 'turn right' by the purser. Both flight attendants were polite, friendly, and helpful, but no going the extra mile. I was greeted by the latest upgrade of the inflight amenities that Cathay highlighted in their latest 'Let your senses guide you' campaign: The seat itself is the same with its spaciousness and is extremely comfortable.  The new Bamford kit is nice, and the new bedding is comfortable, but no more than before. The pillow is too large, but the red small cushion is soft and a pleasant addition. The welcome drink is downgraded from champagne to a small glass of comparatively cheap Jing tea! Then came the meal itself: the same caviar with champagne that was not well chilled, lobster main course sounded great on the menu but came out exceedingly bland and tasteless. No cheese was offered voluntarily by the staff. The dessert of passion fruit pie was sickeningly sweet and disgusting. After dinner, chocolate was given out but then retrieved as I slept so I had to ask again afterwards. All in all a very disappointing dinner. That is in line with my last meal with Cathay in Business, which was inedible. The flight overall was very bland, and nothing special, unlike the First in Lufthansa or Swiss, which was classy and luxurious. In summary, the latest revamped First is disappointing with cosmetic changes and suggestive of cost cutting, not worthy of a full first fare.

"""not travel with Cathay ever again""","San Francisco to Beijing via Hong Kong. I have been a Marco Polo member and several flights back and forth from the USA and Asian countries every year. Today, I called in to request a refund of a ticket that I had canceled several weeks ago. When I canceled, I thought that that was enough and I didn't have to call them to ""request for a refund"" until I realized that the fund has not been credited back to me. After waiting for more than 30 minutes, I talked to an agent. She started the conversation with a nice greeting. Then after she realized that the travel date of the CANCELED ticket has been passed and I didn't call in for the refund request earlier, she began to tell me that I have to be charged for ""no-show"" and ""cancelation fee"" (even though my ticket was canceled within the 24-hour grace period). To be honest, I didn't even know what I was supposed to call to ""request"" this refund, and I explained to her my situation. She put me on hold for a little while and talked to someone. She then came back and told me that Cathay can waive the no-show fee but not the cancelation fee. I told her that I did cancel within 24-hour and Cathay is obliged to not charge me any cancelation fee. I'm not unhappy because of the charge she insisted, but actually about what she was saying next. She said ""if you don't have anything else to say, then finish paying for the charge because I don't have time to stay on the line with you for this issue"". Really? I waited more than half an hour for the call. I admit, there are many customers on the line, but our call was not even 5' yet and more than 90% of the time it was about her checking the system and talking to someone else. But more importantly, I have never experienced any response like this from any customer service reps, and certainly not from Cathay Pacific customer service. Then I politely asked her that I'd like to speak to her manager. She told me ""ok"", but then she re-directed me back into the mainline and there was the wait all over again. Honestly, this is the WORST experience I have ever had from any type of customer reps. Since the time I started flying with Cathay, the service continues to go down spirally.

Being a OneWorld airline I can accumulate points and status credits to go to my Qantas account. Overall the experience on CX is satisfying. From check in (at the CX First counter on account of being a Platinum with Qantas and One World Emerald. This is important even when in the economy cabin). Lounge was familiar at Sydney being the Qantas First. Boarding painless. Now the aircraft is one that is love - hate. It is the 777 - 300. Comfortable ride but its downsides are well known. 10 abreast seating a cabin that is narrower than the Qantas A380's i'm used to and oh boy is the 777 a noisy jet. By comparison the 380 is whisper quiet and the 777 sibling, the 787 Dreamliner is quiet also. The economy seats were fine although the padding was a little firm. The IFE is very good but loaded up with Netflix I did not really use it save for the excellent maps. Now being an Emerald One World, the CSM was very attentive. Three individual cabin crew introduced themselves including the CSM. It's a very nice touch from an airline that I do not often fly with but shows the advantage of One World membership. Of the other OW airlines I fly with (American and British) only Cathay gave such attention. The F & B was not really sampled as I had eaten in the lounge. But it looked fine. Overall the flying part was satisfying except for the loudness of the 777! Now HK airport is one mighty big place. I had a 4 hour layover and headed to the Wing which is one of Cathay's flagship lounges. It was 5.30 am in the morning so the rest of the airport was closed. Separate review of the lounge.

I was comfortable enough to sleep for 3 hours on this flight and the only remaining time awake was meal time.

While the cabin crew and flight crew continue to offer professional service, it can only be a matter of time before Cathay becomes a Chinese domestic airline. Take that comment as you will - all Chinese carriers today are all terrible and what with HK it's a matter of time. My last business class was in the now defunct Jet Airways and I would prefer that over what I experienced today: 1) No wifi. 2) Movies and TV are biased towards Chinese / HK releases with family oriented fillers in the English section. Disappointing to find absolutely nothing to be watched. 3) A lacklustre menu, but I went for the fillet steak. If you like stringy, stewed and overcooked steak with a taste of low cost cooking oils then this is is tour flight, tepid gravy with a skin, tepid potato scooped tasting of oil not butter. 4) Mediocre seat not designed for anyone over 5.5' The transfer information screen really sums it up. All the fights are there, but with no actual usable transfer information. Lounge experience equally poor. We talk of Emirates going downhill, but why not when the competitors drop to this.

I'm not really a big guy (185/85kg), but I suffered in that tiny economy seat. Behind me was a similarly tall guy, whose knees were constantly in my back. I could barely move in that seat and I'm surprised that there are no restrictions as to how small a seat can be. But looking at the 'Premium Economy', I know what Cathay economy used to be. The other aspect is food and beverage. For a long-haul flight of more than 7 hours I expect decent meals and good supply of at least water to prevent dehydration. Neither was provided sufficiently. Especially the breakfast was a total joke. I'd be ashamed to serve that. As far as hydration is concerned, I asked twice to get more water and was ignored. In the morning I asked for more coffee and was ignored as well. Does the crew have too much stress? They used to be a lot more caring, attentive and forthcoming. The only advantage I felt was the 30kg baggage allowance, but even that becomes more and more of a standard and does not give Cathay an edge over other airlines.

The crew handed out a menu which is very useful for making meal options. The flight departed on time from Manchester and lunch service was provided an hour after took off.

The customer service is fantastic and the cabin staff should be commended, as well as the ground staff, who I have found to be timely and efficient. The only criticism that I have is that I found it difficult to sleep due to the constant flow of cabin staff who made their way to the kitchen area.

In the meantime, I was questioned by a young security staff asking me silly questions about my trip. He was rude and repetitive and cold hardly speak English. When we finally boarded, the flight was delayed and only left the gate about 50 minutes after departure time. On board, the PE seats are a fail in my opinion as they are definitely not 20 inches wide and appear no different to an economy seat in terms of width. I have flown Premium Economy on the Cathay Pacific 777-300 and although they are older type seats, they are wider. The seat pitch is good as is the recline but when the passenger in front has their seat reclined, it gets very tight.

I was told to get the boarding pass when I arrived in Madrid, this despite my plea that I had under 1.5 hours transit time. Things got worse when I arrived in Madrid. There was no Cathay Pacific counter in the transit hall, so I approached the Iberia counter to explain I needed my boarding pass to clear immigration in order to catch my flight to Hong Kong.

My only way to get the boarding pass was to get out of transit and check in at the Cathay counter. I kept pleading and finally the Iberia staff asked what time was my flight, and when I told her it was taking off in less than an hour, she took out a little notebook, found a number and called a Cathay Pacific line. The instruction from Cathay was to have her manually write down my name and flight number on a piece of paper, stamped with the Iberia company seal and present it to immigration. Her words to me were: ""I'm not sure if this works but you will have to try. Now run, there is no time."" So I ran as fast as I could.

I'm not sure if others have experienced similar with a code share partner refusing to issue a boarding pass because the airlines are on different systems.

"""most disappointed in Premium Economy""","My husband and I flew from London to Hong Kong using Cathay Pacific We were most disappointed in the Premium Economy seats. Our seating was at the back of the section actually in the economy cabin with a curtain drawn only after dark between us and the front row of Economy by using an angled curtain. The flight was uncomfortable because the leg rest would not fold back under the seat properly and the footplate which is minimal spun around so it was difficult to keep the feet on straight footplates. Staff did their work pleasantly but were not in evidence after the meal was served. One had to locate a remote control for being able to call a staff member and the remote control was not immediately evident being by one's thigh so it proved difficult or impossible to get staff attention without this knowledge. As a concession to Premium Economy, a fancy printed menu was received for the meal but when the meal arrived not only were they out of most options but the grey sludge which appeared as the remaining fish dish was most unappetising. As I was next to the economy passengers there appeared no difference between the meals in each cabin although I think there must have been some slight difference. Premium Economy is that only in name in Cathay Pacific. There was minimal extra room between seats and it was very difficult for the person on the window to climb over the person on the aisle to go to the toilet. We had also done the Hong Kong London sector going and the comments are the same.

"""experience was somewhat confusing""","Dubai to Manila via Hong Kong. I have always been a fan and loyal customer of Cathay Pacific and been happy with the level of service and product. However, earlier this year, I flew with Singapore Airlines, economy, and there I experienced a superior economy class service and product. From IFE panel and content, cabin crew service and food. To mention, They offered hot towel and simple amenity kit, in their economy class. This recent experience with CX, DXB-MNL via HKG was somewhat confusing. I am going to blame it due to being a full flight, and service will be affected. Just to note some, male cabin crew told a female passenger who asked for assistance with her luggage storage when there was no space “why you came late?”. Another female cabin crew, while I was watching, suddenly called my attention and I thought she was offering me hot drinks. I replied “coffee” and she clarified if I was the one who asked for tea earlier. When I said no, she moved on, i am not sure if she apologized for it and at least should have offered if I wanted coffee. There was also a minor glitch with IFE for few minutes. The saving grace, the CX935 HKG-MNL leg. Crew were all friendly, captain  very jolly and inflight service manager sound very friendly on announcement. A350-900 felt new, cool seat design, IFE panel and interior were amazing. DXB airport ground crew were all friendly, polite and helpful.

The pro is 4-5 flights a day from Heathrow to Hong Kong and onward to many Asian cities. Service and product is consistent. However for a premium economy passenger (I often fly their business class and find it underwhelming) I think other Asian airlines do a much better job. The seat is comfortable but very dated. On my return journey the economy class cabin had received a make over - with more seats squeezed in but also new IFE installed. Premium economy meanwhile still had the old IFE and old deco. I also found Cathay Pacific entertainment very limited. Catering onboard was not good. I always eat in the lounge when I fly with CX and skip meals onboard. Even their business class meal is not up to standard let along Premium Economy offerings. I also found service deteriorating. Most of the crew were robotic and just about to manage their tasks. Also depends on your luck. On some of the 777 premium economy you have to go to economy class to use the toilets. And when you reach there the toilets are not clean.

"""My experience  was horrific""","My first experience on Cathay Pacific was horrific. I waited in line for 2 hours at JFK to board flight 841 to Hong Kong (with a connection to Koh Samui) that was scheduled to leave at 10am on Wednesday June 26th while the gate attendant kept saying there was a minor technical delay and we would be boarding in a few minutes. After two hours the desk attendant said while the flight was not cancelled we had to all leave the gate immediately and pick up our luggage. I called to reschedule my flight but was told I could not do so because I was already checked in for fight 841 and had to go to the service desk. After waiting another hour for my luggage I went to the business class service window where I had a three hour wait to be helped. There was pandemonium at the window with hordes of people crowding the counter and the agents ignoring the lines. After waiting for hours and finally getting an agent to help me I was told that I was already rebooked on flight 845 which was leaving at 1am the following morning. I had not received an email or text about this and it appears I waited in line for hours for no reason. When I showed up for flight 845 at 10pm that night after losing a day of my life waiting at JFK I was told it was overbooked and they did not have a seat for me. I was trying to connect to a flight to Koh Samui where I had reservations at a resort. In the end I was booked on a flight that went to Vancouver and then on to Hong Kong which added five hours to my flying time. I missed an entire day at the resort where I was headed. And the worse of it all is that there was no communication from the airline.I paid $10,000 for this business class ticket and spent the money hoping that by going business class I would not be subjected to so much stress. I am a frequent flyer on Delta and American Airlines and although they have their problems I have never experienced anything like this before in terms of the lack of communication, misinformation, pandemonium at the check-in desk, customer service that said it could not help me because I was checked into a flight that never took off, being rebooked onto a flight that had no capacity and lack of any apparent management oversight.

It was a full flight on an ancient aircraft which might have been doable except for the inconsistency with the cabin crew. I found any interaction with some was most unpleasant. Others were helpful but few. After seeing the menu I was waiting for refreshments to arrive. I watched the trolley loaded in the galley and was totally ignored. I was surprised and with the attitude of the female crew member in my area hesitant to ask. As this woman was abrupt, dismissive, actually bordering on rude. Therefore I left the flight certainly looking for some refreshment. These flights are not budget and the disdain I experienced was awful.

The customer service was terrible and they just keep reminding me it was American Airlines that caused me to miss the original flight not them so they were not obligated to help me.

"""falls behind what I expected2","Travelled Ho Chi Minh City to Dubai via Hong Kong on 29 June 2019 on B777-300 and B330-300 respectively. Smooth check-in with 3 business class counters open. My luggage got checked in to the next 4 legs (including on another ticket with Kenya Airways). Nice. Priority lane for security and lounge in Le Saigonnais (was given 2 choices) were fine. First flight delayed from SGN. An early announced 1 hour delay ended up to be 2 hours made me miss my HKG-connection by 2 hours. That caused me to miss my connection in HKG where staff waited for me tried to rebook and examined a lot of option. Next CX flight to DXB kicked off only 10 hours later and made me lose my onward tickets (2 legs). A lot of courtesy, assistance, and sympathy was received in HKG due to the delay but the results and outcome eventually became nil as they regretted early promised options of sending me onwards via Jo-burg or with Emirates to Dubai. Suffered many hours in desperation trying to sort out my further connections from their Bridge Lounge. First flight world  class cuisine and caring. Business class full.  Second flight so, so – dinner hardly edible. Both flights: FAs are active, caring, and truly professional. Beer choices are a disaster and limited to mass produced industrial stuff (Heineken, Carlsberg, Foster, and San Miguel). No WiFi; good IFE. Clean aircraft. Good lounges in HKG. Delay unacceptable and delay handling unsatisfactory: was denied to see the manager as the staff would not allow. They pay lipservice, a lot of lipservice, but significant results, actions, or willingness to pay for any additional routing are not to be seen. They let down passengers by eventually being stingy: nothing must cost them anything additional. Not a true business class experience. The airline falls behind what I expected.

"""something has recently gone very wrong""","London to Hong Kong. I have been flying this long haul route for some years, and often with Cathay, in fact this sector recently as well. I’ve never posted a review and never had cause for complaint before now. But something has recently gone very wrong with this previous exceptional airline. On boarding, even though I was on early, I wasn’t offered a drink and the staff seemed manically busy. But that’s not a biggie. After takeoff, the usual polite approach about meal choices - and this is where it all went wrong. The choices where limited (OK, it happens) and pretty dreadful. The ‘express’ option was either a vegetarian salad (OK, I’ll live with that as well) or soup (soup??). That’s it. So now I’m pressed for what I’m going to have for brunch (brunch? Where did brunch come from? Wasn’t mentioned on the last three same sectors I’ve done). I can’t describe the options as other than the omelette the words were unknown to me - I investigated further and found one that was fried turnips with some sort of porridge on top. No thanks, so I gave up. By the way, later on I was told that first class had cereals and croissants and toast - are you kidding me? So back to ‘dinner’. The vegetarian choice was a warm salad which sounded ok - and by the way, still haven’t been offered a drink which would have been nice. The ‘meal’ arrived with half a glass of red wine (which was good - disappeared quickly though), and wait for it. It was a sort of salad although you couldn’t see it as it as an orange foul smelling hot sauce had been poured on it. Disgusting. I politely handed it back, gave up and asked for the cheese. That appeared a little later - three water crackers, three grapes and two tiny wedges of cheese. Two and a half hours now passed - asked for a top up of wine. It never came, so I gave up, put my tray on the floor, drank some water and went to sleep. Six hours later, tried to get a tea, told the seat belt light was on and they couldn’t. Ok, I get that, but believe me, there was zero turbulence that anyone could possibly feel and the crew had disappeared. Got my fried turnips (sans porridge) and water at “brunch”, then when the bumps increased, off came the seat belt sign and I got a cup of tea and the chief of cabin crew got me a small croissant from first class! No, I’m not a whinger, yes, I understand safety and I know an airline when it’s losing the plot - sorry Cathay but I worked with you some years ago, have flown this route countless times, but we have choices now, and that was a shocker.

"""I would fly them again""","Barcelona to Hong Kong. This was my first time flying with Cathay Pacific. I had very high expectations of such airline; they were met but only to a certain extent. I did my check in using its app; it was fine, I have seen smoother apps, but good overall. Bag drop and boarding in Barcelona was very easy - they even gave fast track access to go through security as it was really crowded and I had 60 minutes. The flight was fully booked, but the 3x3x3 configuration of the a350 is a big plus as it does not feel that crowded. Seats very comfortable, with a massive touch screen, foldable support for phones and tablets, USB charger and an incredibly convenient cup holder. Also, decent leg room. However, in my own opinion, IFE was sort of limited. Two of the major disappointments were service and food. Yet and by all means, they were not bad! Service was correct and very attentive, but I never get that vibe that makes you feel extra special. In regards to food, it was also ""just"" correct - not different to more average airlines. I have to say it was fantastic that you can order hot noodle cups at any point as a snack. I am not 100% sure if that was the A350, but I dealt with jet lag better after that flight. The cabin was at a very convenient temperature, air was not very dry (and I feel it instantaneously as I am using contact lenses). Overall, a very good flight with no complaints. However, and due to Cathay's reputation, I expected to have a better opinion after flying them.

Great choice from the menu including a Wagyu burger they make from the galley - very delicious. Seats are shaped like a pod so there is plenty of personal space to stretch legs and relax (pod stretches out to form a comfortable bed to sleep in). IFE is fine, with a good choice of movies, music, games etc. Staff are attentive and keep an eye on any requirements during the flight.

"""found the food and service ok""","I used to fly Cathay Pacific Business between Europe and Asia (and was disappointed with the service) but had to fly Premium Economy this time due to the high price during holiday season. Overall I think it represents better value than business class. Check in at London Heathrow was fully automatic - you have to print out the boarding pass, luggage tag and attached it to your bag and drop it using a machine. Not an issue here. Boarding was smooth and easy and we took off on time. Hot towel and welcome drink were provided. I was able to secure the first row of the cabin and found the leg room much better than other seats in PE. However the screen is stored below the arm rest so if you plan to watch a lot of movie or have gate to gate entertainment this is the row to avoid. The A350 used for Hong Kong to Taipei sector is far superior than the B777 for long haul. I found the food and service ok - given the fact that it was sub standard in business class. One thing I don't appreciate is unlike EVA which I often fly with, the toilets were not regularly cleaned. I also found the selection of movies poor. When I booked my Premium Economy ticket I was inform that the flight from Hong Kong to Taipei would be operated by A330 without PE so I was allocated a seat in economy. When I arrived at the gate I spotted that it was changed to A350 with PE and check with the ground staff if it is possible to get a seat in PE.

"""satisfied with my experience""","This was my first time flying Cathay so I cannot compare it to its previous glory days. Overall I was satisfied with my experience. Cathay is comparable to the other better airlines out there, though none of them are particularly great these days. I liked that I could check in 48 hours in advance and take 2 suitcases with an economy fare, which is better than most airlines. Having to enter my advance passenger information 4 times (once for each flight there and back) was ridiculous, however. Boarding was well set up, with separate lines clearly signposted for each class of passenger. This prevents massive scrums to board. On both flights (B777 and A350), legroom was good, seat recline was excellent, and IFE was very good with large selection of entertainment and high quality screens. Cabin service was efficient if rather robotic and cold. Meals were pretty decent, especially the Asian dishes. I particularly liked the curry fried fish with rice and the noodles with dumplings. On my return, the flight from Perth was delayed by 2 hours. I received good advance notification via email and text message about this, so I could leave 2 hours later to the airport. Fortunately the delay worked out well for me, as it reduced my stopover in Hong Kong from 9 to 7 hours! I have two major criticisms, both regarding the 15-hour flight between Toronto and Hong Kong: 1) The new 10-abreast seating on the B777 is awful (apparently Cathay used to have 9-abreast seating until recently). The seats are very narrow and the armrests stick-thin. For 15 hours you are constantly being elbowed, knocked and brushed by your neighbour as well as people walking down the aisle if you have an aisle seat. I have a very slender and narrow build, so I cannot imagine how passengers with broad shoulders or who are overweight can tolerate this seating. Sadly, virtually all airlines now have this 10-abreast seating on their B777s, so passengers may have little alternative but to suffer. The FAA should not have allowed this layout, especially for super-longhaul flights like this. 2) There were only 2 meals served on this very long flight: one after takeoff and one before landing. No meal service for 12 hours in-between!! ""Snacks"" were available in the galley throughout the flight, but they were minuscule (literally bite-size) and unhealthy. There really should have been a third meal or proper snack box served mid-flight. I'm not sure if this is standard among other airlines for super-longhaul flights, but it's woefully inadequate. Despite these two criticisms, and with alternative airlines not really being better overall, I would choose to fly Cathay again.",1,7,M Martin,2019-05-04,yes,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,Toronto to Perth via Hong Kong,April 2019,3,4,4,3,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
"""just another ok airline""","Sydney to Phuket via Hong Kong. As others have said in recent times, I don’t believe Cathay deserve their 5-star rating anymore. I have a long history of flying Cathay, going back to 1979, on one of their final B707 flights into SYD. This trip was very, very ordinary to say the least. Firstly, I chose the flights I did, so as not to fly with their 10-abreast B777ERs. So, all 4 sectors were flown with A330s, 2 with mainline, 2 with Dragon. Much more comfortable. I found the cabin crews were still excellent. The problems come from what they are given to work with and offer passengers. Just off the top of my head, in addition to the race-to-the-bottom that are the 10-across B777 configurations, in the past 10 months since my last trip, the following have gone from Y-class service: amenity kits, refresher towels before takeoff, juice or water prior to take off, deserts on the meal trays (the ice creams which are now the dessert, had always been an “extra”). Until now, I’d go out of my way to fly with CX. No longer. I’ll use them if it makes geographical sense to do so, like Aust - Europe and that, mainly due to the Marco Polo club benefits. But no longer, say, for Aust - N.America, as I quite often gladly did in the past. All very sad!

"""had to sit in the airport for 14.5 hours""","Arrived at Perth for my return trip to London LHR to be advised that the flight was delayed by 2 hours. As a consequence I would miss my connecting flight at Hong Kong (HK) so they had rearranged this. This resulted in a 14.5 hour stopover in HK. I was not happy and clearly distressed. I advised them I had a health condition and  could not sit in an airport for 14.5 hours. I purposely chose a stort stopover (and paid a premium for it) as long haul travel is challenging anyway. I was advised that I would be put up in a hotel in HK airport. On this basis I took the flight. On arrival in HK there was no hotel. I was however given access to the Business Class lounge. Whilst this was very comfortable, I still had to sit in the airport for 14.5 hours. I am not happy. I have repeatedly asked to discuss this with someone at the airport and have been given a customer comment form to complete and post off! This is not helpful!

My second leg is from Hong Kong to San Francisco. Since the connection time is short, I was advised by a Cathay Pacific service person to check if there is a Cathay Pacific person hold the sign with next flight number when I get out of the corridor. If so, ask the person for help in the case of an urgent transfer to the new gate is needed. When I got out the corridor, I quickly found a man behind the CX892 sign. I asked him what the gate number is. He asked me to give him the boarding pass. After he checked, then quickly gave me another boarding pass and said you had been assigned to next airplane, CX872. It is five hours and fifty-five minutes delay from CX892. I asked to give me back the original boarding pass. He refused. There is another passenger got the same treatment after me. Our request and argument were rudely rejected We decide to go to the original gate anyway. When we arrived at the original gate, there were still about a dozen people in line for boarding. We asked to aboard this original plane. The service person said she can’t, but she called to ask. After a few minutes, she said we can’t.

With more details mentioned above, we could arrive the new gate, at least 10 minutes before the door was closed, with our original boarding pass in hands, if we didn’t see the CPA person at the exit gate. Below is part of reply by a Customer Relations Executive of Cathay Pacific: “where we foresee that a passenger will not make it for the connecting flight, we will make alternative flight arrangement for the passenger. While I understand that you saw that the door for your original connecting flight was open and the boarding was still in process, as mentioned above you were already rebooked on another flight”. I simply trust the airline will accommodate if there is a short delay in the first leg. Don’t be so naive, there is a trap.

I like the A350 plane it was extremely quiet and comfortable; the business class seat offers great privacy and was very spacious unlike most other airlines in this configuration. onboard amenities (amenity kits and duvet) offered were really good quality. Unfortunately that's where the pros end. There are a lot of areas that Cathay will need to improve to make their business class passengers happy: First of all the cost cutting has gone too far. They have removed all the fresh flowers from the cabin and keep the toiletries in the lavatory to minimum. They also don't provide pajama and slippers to the passenger. I am not too bother about PJ but slippers should be the basic essential - most other airlines even offer that in economy. Secondly, I like the design of the new menu as it's more interesting and casual but the execution is badly done. Presentation of food was not great and food didn't taste nice at all. It feels like a economy class food placed on a better plate. Wine menu is also not impressive as they serve simply the cheapest supermarket wine. Service in the long haul flights was definitely short of expectation. Very minimal interaction with the passengers even in the day flight, and the service was very robotic with smile. For the night flight the service was non existing. Choice of movies is always very limited unless if you fancy Hong Kong movies. It is very strange as the service in short haul flight was slightly better. Overall if you can get a good price with CX and/or access to one of their flagship lounges then it's not a bad option; otherwise there are so many better Asian/European airlines that provide better service and software for the business class.",1,4,N Jung,2019-04-06,no,Business Class,Solo Leisure,London to Taipei via Hong Kong,January 2019,5,2,4,2,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Crew on my side of the aisle were courteous, once again acknowledging my Emerald status, however on my friends side the attendant basically barked at her, and at Cathay they have a trend of screaming ‘mind your knees’ as they pull the cart up the aisle seemed very unprofessional. The Pier lounge at Hong Kong was outstanding. No Emerald recognition on the LGW sector, crew seemed very new and unsure of their role, I think Cathay’s more ‘Senior crew’ work in the premium cabins.

"""the worst customer service""","Newark to Hong Kong. This is the airline with the worst customer service that we have ever experienced. We were travelling to attend a wedding. We drove 3 hours to the airport with no indication of the airline being delayed or diverted. After parking and arrived at the departure hall, we were approached by the crew members that our flight has been diverted to Toronto due to weather. We were asked to wait for further information. We arrived around 10:00 pm with departure time at 1:30 am. After 1.5 hour wait, we were told the flight has been canceled and we were to call the numbers on the sheet of paper that we were handed out. We were appalled! There are around 10 CX uniformed employees there and were not doing any re-booking or issuing any vouchers or do anything but to tell us to call and keep calling. Of course we couldn't get through. After trying for a while with no success, we decided to drive back as there was no point waiting at the airport since no one could help us there. Couldn't get through until 3 am in the morning and they said there are no flights available for us to reach our destination on time. We had to cancel and still waiting to see if we can get refunded. Called my family to convey the bad news to them. Our kids were extremely disappointed as they were supposed to be the flower girl and boy. We had a luggage of kids favor to hand out at the wedding as well. Our family had to seek alternatives last minute. I cannot believe it with my own eyes that this is happening. We were left stranded and had to seek our own solutions. The cost of the ticket is not even a budget airline and the service is beyond unimaginable. We will never ever take Cathay again.

There were more food options which is always nice. The food presentation was excellent and far better than the old style food brought on the trolley. I liked the idea you could choose one of the mid flight snacks as lighter meal instead of the main meal. The only thing I didn't like was that the cheese course was now an alternative to the dessert rather than before it being a course in itself. So you could only have one or the other rather than both. The IFE software has been upgraded to the new style system seen on the A350, which I love. However the hardware is still old and found the screen resolution not great and unable to cope at times with the higher resolution films with blocky pictures. One other thing that needs to change is the awful fragrance (or lack of) on the hot towels - please, please Cathay address this!

"""kept up their good service on-board""","I've been flying Cathay Pacific London to Hong Kong and back for nearly ten years now. Here's why. I started off flying Virgin because I'd already accumulated air miles with them and the price was right. However I soon found out that their airline staff are overworked and tired, food was mediocre and, worst of all, I still couldn't acquire enough points to get into the Business Lounge despite frequent flying. A quick calculation showed that if I joined Marco Polo club I'd go Silver after a few flights and I would get to book extra legroom seats free of charge with the advantage of extra luggage allowance plus being able to check in and queue for the flight using Business Class. No brainer then! Over nearly a decade Cathay have kept up their good service on-board. It seems like the airline staff can't do enough for you, including serving snacks and noodles and drinks throughout the flight. Meals are good (and much better when they upgrade me to Premium Economy or Business which happens when the flight is full), the entertainment system is excellent and the extra legroom seat option is a bonus. Having said that, relatively recent changes to the seating has resulted in less padded seats with a recline method that is uncomfortable, making it difficult to sleep, so deduct a star for that.

Instead of a long write up, below is a list of things we have encountered so far. Assistant at the check-in counter is impatient. Speak so low and unclear.

The plane took off 15 minutes late from HKG with a further 30 minutes on the apron for some reason. Cabin crew asked what we wanted for dinner and I made a choice and also made a request for a cocktail and although they had the ingredients for Negroni the attendant said she couldn't make one. I said I'd make it but she also told me they do not offer drinks in miniature bottles. I changed the order to a large Bloody Mary. In very short order they started laying the dinner table and I reminded her that I wanted a drink. This took some 25 minutes to arrive with 4 cabin crew talking in a group (perhaps working out how to make it). It was clear that I was not getting a second. No nuts were offered although my partner opposite was given some. My meal arrived - some very nice stir fried fish. There was no starter no salt or pepper. I was told starters were optional and I should have asked for one. This was the salad I didn't get. I asked for a glass of wine. The male attendant said he would get the wine list. I mean they only offer 4. I said the first bottle you come to. I got a glass of white. He said it's sauvignon blanc by the way. I didn't hear him and asked him what he had said (I'm 75 - I'm a little deaf - it happens). He told me how sorry he was that his accent was difficult to understand.  Odd comment. No pudding was offered but I asked for one and got an ice cream. The staff was borderline polite but everyone was going to sleep and quickly. I got up for a lavatory break. They were in use.

"""I cannot recommend Cathay""","Bangkok to San Francisco via Hong Kong. I am normally impressed with the service and family-friendliness of airlines in Asia (compared with US airlines), however, we had a terrible experience traveling with a child on Cathay Pacific. When I booked my flight, I confirmed on the phone with Cathay that we could use our car seat in the aircraft (we purchased a separate seat/ticket for our almost 2-yr-old). On our first flight, they would not let us bring the car seat onto the plane, even just to try and see if it would fit. The new B777 configuration has narrow seats in a 3-4-3 layout. On our long haul flight from Hong Kong to San Francisco, I had to really persuade the staff to even let us bring the car seat on. They argued and kept saying that it probably would not fit. Of course, it fit just fine on the A350 and with our active toddler was essential in enabling him to sleep on the 12-hour flight. Ground staff members were remarkably rude and unhelpful (again, very non-typical for Asia-based airlines, which generally have friendly service). Our first flight was delayed two hours, so we called the airline and switched to an earlier flight. We rushed to airport to make it on time, only to sit on the plane in the engineering bay for almost three hours as they worked on an engine issue. The crew did very little to make this experience more enjoyable (water, snacks, perhaps?). Our carry-ons were well under the maximum allowable, and yet since our toddler can't carry his own, it was a struggle to haul things into the plane. We asked if the staff could help and they snipped back at us - you have to be able to manage all of your luggage. (Yes, I understand that, but our two-year-old, who has his own seat/ticket and luggage, cannot carry his own. Also, we have to carry him, so that limits what we can carry). Can we make exceptions for families with young children and help them out a little? I cannot recommend Cathay to any families with young children.

The A350 is truly a modern aircraft, it's noticeably quieter and up to date technologies available throughout the aircraft such as wifi, touch screen TV etc. The PE sets are laid out in 2x4x2, and is relatively more spacious with ample leg room and good seat pitch. In terms of hardware, CX did very well this time. Software wise (food and service), it was rather mediocre. Crew did not look welcoming, nor happy to be there. It was streets behind their competitor on this same route Singapore airlines. For PE, we are served economy class meal, portion are noticeably smaller than many years ago, plastic cutlery, no salt, pepper sachet and toothpicks provided, it's by request only, all scream to me big cost-cutting. Presentation, portion and taste of food was rather bland, at least we were offered a cup of Hagen Diaz ice cream to finish off the meal. The load was very full, crew were efficient to go through their duties, but there's no charm or smile at all. The good old days when flying with CX was an amazing experience was truly long gone.

I showed her my travel agents confirmation letter of my booking and she went away to check this only to return twenty minutes later to tell me that they had found it. Then off to the check in counter to pay for my extra baggage, twelve kg in all. I was told that this would be AUS$646. I pointed out that the website states:  twelve dollars per kg. They told me that this was only if you pre booked it but myself had tried to do this, my travel agent tried even the Cathay Pacific rep tried but we simply could not do this over the internet. It also states on the CP website: Take more with you for a modest fee and Pre- paid extra lugage enjoy a 20% discount. Now I thought $12 per kg is modest but USD 40 over the top.

And there was duty free shopping! No North American carrier matches this level of offering on this route. The fares are very competitive. On my flight, there were lots of empty seats and attendants encouraged us to move to empty rows to stretch out for some winks. A dinner was served with three entree choices including a vegetarian dish. The food was basic - unmemorable. Cabin lights were turned off for this late night flight. Cabin was kept clean. Flight attendants efficient. English announcements by lead in-flight crew was difficult to understand because of accent. The departure was delayed because of late arrival of inbound aircraft. Initial gate assigned was changed from one concourse to another. Public information displays did not reflect changed times and gates causing customers to scramble from one end to another.

I have flown with them on 4 occasions in the past 2 years and have been satisfied, however on my trip last week I was quite shocked by how far standards have dropped. The main thing that stood out for me was just how cold and rude the cabin crew were. All service was robotic. On the Cape Town - Hong Kong sector one of the flight attendants barked orders to a passenger and then made sarcastic comments under his breath as the passenger moved away. Later in the flight the same crew member could be heard mumbling after a passenger asked for water in the middle of the flight. Part of the problem here is that the crew made zero drinks runs during the 13 hour flight apart from those served with the meals. Obviously this will increase the number of passenger requests for drinks. When I went to the rear galley at the halfway point of the flight to ask for noodles (offered on the menu as a mid flight snack) this same flight attendant told me to ""ask someone else because I am going to rest now."" On the Hong Kong - Jakarta flight (4 hours 30 flight, so no shortage of time for a single meal service) the crew were in such a hurry to get the meal service done that they were not offering the passengers a meal choice. They just said - ""you will have option X, OK?"" I just said yes because I was so startled by the rudeness.

We have been decade long supporters of this airline flying up to twice a year, both regionally and long haul and we notice standards are clearly falling. Early 2018 for the first time we lost a day in Taipei trying to correct Cathay's internal fight scheduling system error on a reserved return flight from Taipei to Sydney to ensure we actually had a return flight. Separately and for the first time we were bumped off a longstanding confirmed mid morning departure (no explanation) Sydney to London into a much earlier flight which caused us ongoing difficulties. Also don't expect much at Gatwick Airport Departures because there is next to nothing by way of assistance. To add insult to injury the airline has recently changed the Economy Reservations process where you now have to pay for a more expensive ticket to continue to reserve your seat with them which represents a sizeable fare increase for many clients and something their cheaper direct rivals simply dont do. They say that you can wait up until 48 hours before departure to apply for a seat on the lower fare but most if not all flights are fully booked well ahead these days so thats just word games for people wanting certainty and anyone who travels knows it. As a rule we already pay more to fly Cathay so the recent seat reservation initiative by them represents no more than a thinly disguised grab for additional revenue and is a very unfortunate decision by them.",1,5,P Regan,2019-01-25,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,Sydney to London via Hong Kong,October 2018,3,3,3,4,2,Cathay Pacific Airways

The Boeing 777 planes were old, tired and uncomfortable, however on the last leg we had an A350 which was much better. Inflight entertainment was poor, the amount of recent films was quite limited. Staff were friendly and efficient. Food for me was not bad, however on one leg the prawns were still frozen. For my wife who is gluten free the food was very limited and quite disgusting. Gluten free gets no choice of food even in business class. One meal was boiled fish, which was overcooked and had no seasoning, often starters were just plain salads and dessert was just ice cream. The worst one was a breakfast which was baked beans, tomatoe and spinach. It seems like gluten free is considered an afterthought on this airline. Even the staff agreed that it was not very good, and that they get many many complaints from gluten free passengers. They asked us to complain as they said the airline did not listen to feedback from staff, only from customers. As such apart from this review we will also make an official complaint. The crazy thing is that this airline is Hong Kong based. Having visited Hong Kong many times we know that Hong Kong has some of the best gluten free food options in the world.

"""look for other options first""","Bangalore to San Francisco via Hong Kong. The crew on Cathay Pacific/Cathay Dragon on Jan 4, 2019 was extremely rude. I have travelled Cathay before, and had issues on the food they serve, but never with the crew onboard. This is the first time, and I was very surprised with their behavior. On the flight from BLR to HKG, the air-hostess asked me my meal preference, and when I asked what they served ( a menu card was not provided), she simply moved on to the next passenger. I had to ask her again, and she sighed and showed me something scribbled on a piece of paper. On the flight from HKG to SFO, I had a bad cough and needed hot water, and the seat belt sign was on, so could not walk up to them. When I pressed on the crew button, they would turn it off and not respond. I had to press the button couple more times before someone came by. Finally a air-hostess showed up with her hands folded and a stern look, and before asking me what I needed, instructed me to turn off the light. I did and asked her politely if I could get some hot water, she said it will take some time. I said that's fine, and she sighed and walked away. I was not sure if I would get it or not. After about 20 min, she got me the water. After that I did not ask for water again. Later during the flight, I pressed on the button again to get some cup-noodles (could not walk up as the seat belt sign was on).

Boarding at Newark delayed by an hour due to a baggage issue but we did land right on time in HKG. The cabin crew were upbeat, warm and welcoming. They were pleasant, smiling and working efficiently throughout the flight. The meal service seemed slow but maybe had more to do with not having enough crew onboard to work such a large economy cabin. The meals onboard were the biggest disappointment. Portions seemed even smaller than before and the quality of both meals was certainly not up to par. Rice was dry and clumpy and the beef with it, overdone and lacked enough sauce. No salt and pepper sachets either. There is virtually no difference between the meals served on the long haul to the shorter medium haul sector to Singapore. The saving grace was the midflight snack bar that I stumbled on when I ventured to the back and to the opposite aisle. Good selection and better quality than the meals themselves, sadly. The seat on the A350 is probably one of the most comfortable, barring the seat back issue - which has been brought up here. Good cushioning, back support and legroom. The IFE screen was sharp, responsive and the selection a tad disappointing with insufficient newer films and I feel a better way to filter or sort the films available according to genre etc, would make selection easier. I loved the Tail and belly cams and the Moving Map was great. The toilets onboard seemed to be showing a surprising amount of wear for a 2 year old plane and the sinks in the 3 toilets I used, didn't drain properly with water remaining for a while.

They talk to us like we are not customers and it feels like they are doing us a favor. I had excess baggage and I get that, either I pay or remove the extra kilos. So I tried to remove all the extra kilos, I came back then the lady checked me in said she has to weigh my hand carry (it was a small backpack with my passport and wallet, then one obnoxious lady interjected and said “Is that your hand carry,? Why you didn’t declare it, she already asked you (refering to the crew who is checking me in) if you have any hand carry?. Before I even start to answer her (which she don’t try to let me) she already said a lot of stuff, and then I answered her that “The crew didn’t ask me about that, she just ask me to put my backpack on the weighing scale”, she don’t really want me to explain and I told her I didn’t know carry on must be weighed too, and if i try to hide it I will not let my sister hold it near me”. I don’t wanna argue with her because I don’t think she will understand what I am saying. I ended up leaving my cabin Trolley to my sister which only had my laptop, go pro and dslr) (9KG my backpck and my cabin trolley). So I had to put it all in my check in luggage. I had travelled many airlines before and I had never experienced what I had experienced in Cathay Pacific. I will never fly with Cathay Pacific anymore.

The seat was very comfortable, and I slept very well on this early morning flight. The inflight entertainment system was new and responsive, and selection of movies and TV shows was incredible. The food was excellent but was not spectacular- as a short morning flight the selection of food and drink was not massive.

The proximity of the pantry was no guarantee for a good service, on the contrary. On departure there was a delay of 20 minutes. We had a clear view in the pantry and saw that passengers in the ""front"" part of the business class were offered a second preflight drink. Not for the part where we were, we were ignored by the cabin crew. When serving the meal, I was probably the last passenger in the plane to get my pork with cold noodles. For the sake of clarity, because we flew several times with Cathay Pacific, I became a member of the Marco Polo club, silver member now. This loyalty is apparently one-sided because at home I filed a complaint and received an automated message that one of the employees of the Customer Relations Department would contact me within 10 days. This has not yet happened, not even to mention that the complaint handling takes longer, nothing. I think this is a shameful way to deal with your customers.

"""horrible experience overall""","I would like to make all potential Cathay Pacific customers aware of the embarrassing and rude customer service my husband and I  received from a Cathay Pacific Customer Service Representative at the Hong Kong airport. We are on our way back from our honeymoon which original route was from USA to Hong Kong to Bangkok. The inflight experience is excellent at Cathay - unfortunately that is where that service and experience stops. We were mocked and spoken poorly about right in front of our faces and in front of other passengers for presenting our business class lounge ticket that was for “post departure” between our 11 hour layover from Bangkok. We had originally booked premium economy and were upgraded to business for the short flight (BKK to HKG). When they did this the check in attendant gave us passes to the lounge for when we arrive in Hong Kong, which was very helpful since we landed at 10:50 and don’t depart until 9:30 the next morning. This was never honored. Instead, we have been waiting in the airport and finally went to the lounge when it opened at 5:30am and were turned away because our flight that got in last night at 10:50 was only good for the lounge until midnight (about 1 hour), when our flight to America leaves at 9am. The representative stopped us from going in the lounge and did not do it in a nice way at all. No recommendation on where to go, no sympathy for us waiting around all night to finally get into the lounge. The saddest part of it all, is the demeanor and attitude change as soon as she saw my American passport. She and her friend immediately started talking and laughing in another language. This was very uncomfortable. This has been a horrible experience overall starting off with our bags being lost and never leaving the USA when we started our honeymoon travels in Bangkok. We had to go looking for clothes around Bangkok for the first half of the day since we were without any luggage. I think the biggest fear of two newlyweds on the other side of the country with oversize baggage (that I paid $150usd to cover for) showed up with 0 bags. Needless to say, the experience has been on edge and not relaxing whatsoever due to all of the mishaps. The inflight team is wonderful and makes sure you are taken care of, if only the Cathay Pacific team was all well-verses in how to take care of two customers that have chosen to travel around the world with them.",1,2,B Rowney,2018-11-02,no,Business Class,Couple Leisure,Hong Kong to new York,November 2018,3,3,1,5,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

"""roughly the same as it’s competitors""","Despite Cathay Pacific being more expensive than Air Canada (on average), I opted for Cathay Pacific on the grounds that they had the midnight flight to Vancouver - this ultimately means that I am able to maximize the amount of time that I have at my destination. Historically, I would’ve told you that Cathay Pacific provides a superior service, but nowadays, it’s roughly the same as it’s competitors. They have more attentive flight attendants and better IFE choices, but that’s about it. The food is okay, but I feel that Air Canada has better food, and despite having wider seats than the former, I still find that Air Canada seats and the cabin as a whole feel more comfy (maybe it’s all the mood lighting). CX888 still operates the 777-300ER exclusively, and while I love 777s, Cathay decided against installing wifi on them. I do applaud Cathay’s commitment to cabin cleanliness - I don’t get any nasty surprises by taking my shoes of or putting my bag on the floor, and they do provide plenty of bathrooms for people. To date, Cathay is still the only airline where I can walk over to the galley and get whatever unhealthy snacks and beverages I want without anyone raising an eyebrow, so that’s nice too, but otherwise if you have some time to spend, and you are operating on a tight budget, the Cathay experience is no longer a distinguishing feature for the airline.

"""outstanding inflight service""","Manila to Hong Kong. Quick short visit to Hong Kong. Flying with Cathay Pacific's brand new Airbus A350-900 on this route (CX918). Checkin in at Manila Internation Airport Terminal 3 was quick and efficient. Out of all airlines flying to and from Manila, Cathay Pacific has the most efficient ground service and handling despite its multiple flights in and out of Manila. Cathay Pacific has recently opened their brand new lounge at the new-ish terminal a few years ago. It had every component that the lounge offers at their Hong Kong lounges minus the showers. Food selection was great as was drinks. Boarding was quick and efficient, doors were closed on time and left the gate on time. Upon boarding, the first thing I noticed was the brand new plane smell and the flight attendant's warmth and friendliness. The seats were brand new, cabin was very clean and very spacious. As soon as I sat down on my seat, I immediately noticed how wide the seats were and how generous the leg room was. The IFE was also their new Stuio CX which offered live TV and Wi-Fi connectivity. Only being a two hour flight, the crew swung into action giving snack bags which contained a biscuit, juice box and a pastry - which to me personally is more than enough for a very short flight despite what others moan and whinge about in here comparing CX's meal service to Philippine Airlines who serve full meal. I personally am not a binge eater and couldn't careless about whether an airline serves a full meal in economy class or not. The snack bag was delicious and more than enough for the entire duration of the flight. After the meal services, the cabin crew again came offering second rounds of drinks. They were all very friendly, warm and chatty. Overall, despite what others have said and complained about Cathay Pacific's service going downhill, having flown with them over 13 times over the last 18 months, I find their service to be outstanding and highly consistent living up to their reputation of being a 5* premium airline. Over the last year, I have flown with other 5* airlines - Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines and both do not even come close to the service Cathay Pacific offers. Overall, if I had the opportunity to swith loyalties from British Airways Executive Club to Cathay Pacific Marco Polo Club, I will in a heart beat but the downside is the difficulty of gaining oneworld status with Cathay Pacific.

Generally their ground staffs were good, but their Surabaya staff were quite unprofessional. I already check in online. Then, when I arrived, before entering the queue, one staff asked my full name and recorded it in some paper (well, that weird, but ok). Secondly, since I told the other staff that I already did self check in, this guy told me to go to bag-drop line, and since one counter was empty, he said I should go there. But the lady said I have to queue (but there was only me in that line. But still, I waited). After few minutes, that lady called me and asked me if I was in business class, which I wasn't.

No reason given why it's late. Ok, whatever. I went to the departure gate. No one there.

The chicken with mashed potatoes was edible, but uninspiring, while the beef congee was too watered down. Neither meal came with condiments such as salt and pepper. Was that due to cutbacks?

(Wait time on the telephone was over 1 hr both times I called!) The flights from JFK - Hong Kong - Siem Reap were fine and the amenities, provided. The flights from Ho Chi Minh to Hong Kong to JFK were awful. Cathay had a delay which caused me to miss my connecting flight. I was promised an upgrade by the gate agent because of the long wait I would have to endure. Upon arrival in Hong Kong, I was denied the upgrade and moved from my window seat to a center seat in the row of 5 seats. After much arguing, they miraculously found a window seat for me. They offered to provide a car in NY to transport me home which, after waiting an hour, they reneged on. However, the most disturbing issue is the advertising of amenities in ""premium"" economy: calf rests at the seat, separate check in and boarding lines and a champagne welcome. None of the amenities were provided. Other than being wider, the seat was no different than flying regular economy. The lines to check in and board were ridiculous and service aboard was awful. Attempts at resolving these issues have been met with a stubborn refusal to acknowledge that they did not provide a ""premium"" experience. Airline has no concern for customer satisfaction. I would never fly them again and certainly, do not recommend spending so much more money for ""premium"" when they don't deliver the product as advertised.",0,2,Maria Giordano,2018-08-31,no,Premium Economy,Solo Leisure,Ho Chi Minh to New York via Hong Kong,March 2018,2,1,1,2,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
"""cabin staff always welcoming""","Gatwick to Melbourne via Hong Kong. Pleased with Gatwick on lunchtime departure. Just check for South Terminal at F Gate, Nice casual boarding [unlike the demeaning line up and wait at Hong Kong]. Cabin staff always welcoming and helpful. Every seat taken - seems a Cathay method. Typically a polite crowd to travel with, majority Chinese, a few Australians and British. I had a low calorie meal on order, so got served maybe 30 minutes ahead of others and by personal delivery. Out of Gatwick the main was delicious fish - very good even if no choice and no menu. Captain message as usual on this airline was English name and well spoken. I rate this airline for having British pilots - gives me confidence in basic skills and also the ability to communicate clearly in the event of difficulties. I told myself the A350 has been in service on this route for over a year, and is used intensively, flying into Gatwick after 11 hours from HK and ready to return at lunchtime. The Cathay themed seats in aqua green are starting to look tired, as also the furniture in the toilets [Try liifting the lid and some stain on the rim]. I require several breaks from sitting as I rarely get to sleep. So I found a small space near the aft toilet where I could pass 30 minutes doing easy knee and toe exercises without being hassled by the crew. [This used to be easier on the 747 with its extra space]. The allocation of toilets was just ok, I counted five located midway and aft. The nice thing about the A350 is that it is not carrying huge numbers, easier to manage. The meals are only average, lacking some extras such as hand towel and block of real cheese. Wine [red or white] comes in a plastic glass - gone is the mini bottle. On boarding, there is no welcome juice or hot towel. The seats feel spacious but are short on supportive cushioning. I actually bolster the seat with the blanket and pillow to support low spine and thighs. The choice of movies is good but falls short of the Qatar Airways range. I enjoy checking the route out over Lowestoft and north to Denmark and the baltic states before an amazing great circle route over Russia through to China. I enjoy the live video cams showing take off and landing. Fortunately daytime on transit in Hong Kong Airport [It is depressingly closed there on night time transits] found a western style breakfast cafe. But kept wishing it was Singapore with its fantastic restaurants. From there Cathay lost points by transferring us to a tired looking B777ER and lining us up like cheap people for 30 minutes before boarding. They could do this much better. Deperture 30 minutes late was not made up. On attempted touch down in Melbourne [shown on video] the pilot aborted landing at the last moment and took off for another attempt. He blamed cross winds for this but I suspect the speed and decline were out of sync. Arrived 4 minutes late turning 11.05 pm. Just one thing to remember, on arrival at Gatwick the Cathay gate is very remote and there are no airport toilets for that sudden need, for maybe 20 minutes hard walking. Impression, love the airline its helpful crew and the route but will have to compare Qatar on price and miss the comfort of Singapore Airport.

I had the impression that I was being sort of punished for ordering a special meal: I was once denied bread, my claim for coffee many times ignored. However, I refrained from complaining.  Seats were fair on Economy and very good on Premium Economy. No particular complaint over seats.  Inflight entertainment was excellent.

The check-in process in Sydney was fast and staff were friendly, although the booking class I booked did not entitle me to pre-book seats at time of purchasing flights, I was able to choose seats a couple of days before when on-line check in opened. On board staff were also friendly and efficient, food served was tasty and there were a few options to choose from and staff went through the aisles often enough to provide drinks when needed.

"""poorest quality airline""","I recently flew Dubai to Auckland via Hong Kong return and was very disappointed with the service. Traveling long haul, I figured it would be worth the extra money to go with a good airline so paid significantly more than competing airlines. Not so! The airline ran out of meals (except for fish) so gave me and a number of other guests a pot noodle snack. They also ran out of chicken and vegetarian meals on the first leg of the trip, even though we were seated in the middle rather than towards the back of the plane. Very poor planning and organization it seems since this seems to be a consistent issue. Although the food was pretty decent to be fair. My bag didn’t make the second leg of the journey despite a 15 hour layover (plenty of time). I’d been in the same clothes for 2 days and was given nothing, not even a toothbrush. I literally had the clothes on my back and travelling from 45 degrees celcius to 12 degrees, I was very, very cold! On the return journey, my husband wasn’t travelling due to a sudden death in the family. Having paid over US $3000 for the flight, I figured at least I’d have an empty seat beside me. I explained this upon check in and was told that they would be re-selling the seat which they did. I hadn’t given due notice to the cancellation due to the circumstance so I wouldn’t be getting any refund or compensation. They didn’t even upgrade me to Premium Economy or Business and there were empty seats. The customer service was astoundingly poor. “Please” and “thank you” we’re rarely reciprocated. When handing out meals, “coming through, coming through, coming through” was belted out and the attendants barged through the aisle. Moral of the story, you don’t always get what you pay for. The point of this review; choose a cheaper airline! I’ve travelled on budget airlines that offer a far superior service and have much better customer service. This is not the rant of someone who expects a stellar service and everything to be pristine. The poor service was consistent on the 4 flights I’ve taken in the last couple of weeks with Cathay Pacific. As a frequent flyer (I’ve flown to a number of countries across 5 continents in the last year just to give some idea), this really is one of the poorest quality airlines I’ve ever flown with and will be avoiding this airline at all cost in the future.",0,3,A Mary O Brien,2018-08-04,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,Auckland to Dubai via Hong Kong,August 2018,3,3,1,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways

"""Very bad experience""","Vancouver to Hong Kong. Very bad experience with the Inflight Service!. I travelled with my husband and 8 month old daughter from Vancouver to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific for almost 12 hours. In the middle of the long flight, a turbulence occurred and the seatbelt sign came on. So I grabbed my baby and held her on my lap, then put on my seatbelt as i could not find the baby seatbelt that the flight attendants have provided earlier. One of the flight attendants came to check on us if our seatbelts were buckled, and asked me if they offered the baby seatbelt, to which i said yes, but i could not find it so i will just look for it later after the turbulence. FA then freaked out and raised her voice, saying “what do you mean you can’t find it? You have to find it now!” Then turned on the overhead light, disregarding my sleeping baby, then shoved my right shoulder away from the back of my seat so she can take a look and try to find the baby seatbelt. Knowing that she won’t stop harassing me and my baby, I woke my husband and asked for his help. When he saw how the FA was treating me and my baby, even he got surprised and blurted out “whoa, whoa, whoa! I’ll take care of them myself.” To which the FA said she just did not want to wake the baby. A totally contradicting statement to what she was doing just minutes ago. I filed a complaint to their Customer Relations Department and got a response through email saying that they “understand how annoying the situation must have been for me” and that they “have shared my letter with the Inflight Services Manager so that they can follow up with the staff members in question”.  They do not care about the experience of their customers and they have rude Flight Attendants.",1,2,Michelle Llarina,2018-06-29,no,Economy Class,Family Leisure,Vancouver to Hong Kong,May 2018,3,1,1,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Manila to Hong Kong return (B777 and A330) was operated by Cathay Pacific Airways while the Hong Kong to Cengdu (A330 / A320) was operated by Cathay Dragon. The seat legroom and width on B777 and A330 are ample while on the A320 (3-3 configuration) is quite squeezed. The HKG-MNL flight is 3-4-3 configuration but at the back where 78A is located has 2-4-2 configuration. 78A might be the last choice for most people but I highly recommend it as it has more space compared to other seats in the economy section. Since the MNL-HKG-MNL is just a short flight, onyl refreshments was served. Coffee is available upon request. For the HKG-CTU-HKG, breakfast is served. The food is good. Storage for coats or jacket is also available and the FA's are willing to assist. IFE selection is enough for a short flight. The flying time is not enough actually to finish one movie. The toilet are clean and are well-maintained throughout the duration of the flight.

"""Check in was very efficient""","London to Hong Kong. Check in was very efficient at Heathrow, staff was friendly and corteous. Requested bulkhead seats and was met with no hesitance. Although me and my other half are both oneworld Sapphire (BA Silver), we were invited and escorted to Fast Track security which is only available for oneworld Emerald members. The Cathay Pacific lounge in Heathrow Terminal 3 was phenomenal. Facilities were great with Aesop products in the showers and bathrooms. The lounge wasn't very crowded. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the lounge was very clean. Boarding process was very efficient. Upon boarding, the cabin crew were warm and friendly. One of the first things I have noticed on boarding the aircraft was how the cabin was clean. At our seats, there was headphones, pillow and blanket. No overnight or amenity kits on the seats but these can be requested from the cabin crew. The seat was very wide, outstanding IFE with great selections of movies and TV prorammes and albums. As soon as the seatbelt sign was off, the cabin crew started the drinks service, given a bag of peanuts and full sized can drinks which is more than sufficient compared to other airlines. Main meal service portion was great, Movenpick Ice Cream handed out and the cabin crew again offered us drinks. The food served on CX is the best I have had on a long haul flight. The cabin crew came along with trays of drink every hour and a self service drinks and snack 'bar' was set up in the galley with plenty of options. Cup noodles were offered half way through the flight with another drinks service. Breakfast was served prior to landing which again is the best I have had on a long haul flight - I chose the chinese option which was amazing. Overall, Cathay Pacific truly deserves its 5 star rating from Skytrax. Nothing went wrong on this flight and I personally don't think Cathay Pacific has a lot to improve on - perhaps Wi-Fi on the plane and upgraded IFE which is already on the way. The cabin crew were very friendly, polite and professional, ensuring lavatories were kept clean, offering drinks and responding to passenger needs promptly.",1,10,R Gannell,2018-06-19,yes,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,London to Hong Kong,May 2018,5,5,5,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
"""Wouldn't recommend this airline""","Manila to Zurich via Hong Kong. I've been flying with Cathay Pacific ever since they started offering non-stop flights to Zurich (2015) and have experienced their economy, premium economy and business classes. The seats are comfortable I like the new A350. That's it. If you're tall, you won't like the business class seats as the space for the foot area narrows significantly. The business class food is also subpar compared to other airlines. The food in all classes is not good in general. Further, the variety of (good) movie options went down significantly. There are barely any new movies and more of classics, the ones you have most likely seen already. Check out the June 2018 options if you can. Ferdinand is probably your best choice. What's the absolute worst, though, is the arrogance and unfriendliness of staff that I've experienced on numerous occasions, particularly of the floor staff. They also don't seem to coordinate/communicate between locations and are often not properly trained about giving customers the correct information.

I chose CRK as I would not want to trouble myself getting out of MNL Airport. Last time I flew CX was in 2009 to RUH. The service and food then was great so I trusted that it would be the same or better. Flight date is 08 June. Check in was brief, pleasant. Felt at home as there were a lot Filipino staff in EWR. Airplane is new, legroom was good. In flight entertainment was great! This is a 15+ hour flight and we had 2 meals and snacks in between. I had dinner around 8 PM. We flew out 1:55 AM. Most of the restaurants near the gates were closed and besides food the airport was expensive. After supper (which was very good. I had beef, fried rice and veggies) I was still hungry. The menu said that they offer cup noodles upon request. The FA gave me another entree! As really am not able to sleep during flights, I walk around. I went to the galley at the back of the plane and they have snacks. Few hours passed, I went to the back and asked for toothbrush. I noticed that they do not provided amenity kits unless you asked. I asked for socks at the beginning of the flight. I think I asked both of these from the team lead FA. She is not smiling, very serious and does not even respond back after saying thank you. I had a feeling that she does not like serving Filipinos because she was from Hong Kong. There was an Indian flight attendant serving my area and I thought it was nice for CX to have diversity in their crew. But I was really disappointed the way this team lead FA treated me. I have read a few reviews and it feels very tight. I guess I have gotten used to western airlines that offer small chats. So snack time came and they were serving cup noodles. I am hungry so I requested for one. The FA was apologetic and told me I can only have one and I did have mine already. But other people are not even having a snack. They served breakfast late.30 mins before landing they are still serving breakfast. Overall I did not enjoy this leg of the flight. Transferred to Satellite terminal in HK. It was packed flight.

I had been bumped to an aisle seat at the back of the cabin and just a couple of feet from the economy class cabin. I queried this at Sydney airport on my departure day. They were unwilling to do anything about it. I asked the lady in my previously booked seat, how she got it. She had booked 9 months after me and was not related to the person sitting next to her, so it was obviously a Cathay malfunction. At no stage did I receive any notification of the seat change.

"""I was suitably impressed""","This was the CX754 from Bangkok to Hong Kong taking off around mid-day. There were two distinctive features about this flight, at least as far as I was concerned. The first is that I hadn't previously flown on the A350 and I must say that I was suitably impressed. Cabin design excellent with spacious overhead lockers, decent sized toilets (no dedicated PE one but it didn't matter) and best of all vastly improved PE seating, both more comfortable and better leg-room than the 777, at least it felt that way. More 350s please! The one downside on this trip is that they served us economy class food for lunch and it was rubbish. Never complained about PE food before (never had to) but this time I am. One additional point to note is that the back row of PE on both sides overlaps with the economy cabin so be advised.",1,7,F Harris,2018-05-01,yes,Premium Economy,Business,Bangkok to Hong Kong,April 2018,5,2,5,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
"""been my best ever flight""","Including the two-hour refueling-stop in Vancouver - where passengers from JFK have to stay on board - the flight from New York to Hong Kong ranks among the world's longest flights. It lasts up to 21.30 hours. Nevertheless it has been my best ever flight in my 26 years of flying. I arrived in Hong Kong as refreshed as I left US East Coast. The cabin on this B777 certainly can't compete with rivals in terms of innovation and technology. But Cathay offer room for privacy, a comfortable bed and a personalized service. For someone who is looking for as much rest as possible this is certainly a good option. On the first leg to Vancouver I skipped dinner because I felt sleepy. Soon after take-off my bed was prepared and I only woke up 30 minutes before landing into Vancouver. I was served the requested cake from the dinner menu and had a quick cup of tea. The best entertainment on board for me was actually watching the ground-staff cleaning, re-catering and preparing the aircraft during the stop in Vancouver for the flight to Hong Kong. Soon after take-off I slept for another five hours. Foodwise I was impressed by the fact that some offerings were freshly prepared such as jasmine rice, toast and scrambled eggs. Dining on-demand is a plus when one tries to overcome jetlag. I was able to start with breakfast instead of dinner options and finish off with dinner options before the early morning landing. The crew and the crew-passenger-ratio on this flight and in this cabin were outstanding. I was well fed and well looked after by two senior crew members and the inflight manager. They made me feel like at home and by wearing pyjamas I actually felt like at home on a lazy Sunday morning, having brunch in bed, reading the papers and looking out of the window, watching the sunrise.",1,10,Tony Spitale,2018-05-01,yes,First Class,Solo Leisure,New York to Hong Kong via Vancouver,April 2018,5,5,5,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

"""Overall, an average trip""","Flew from Toronto to Hong Kong on CX825 and onwards to Bangkok to CX617. Note that Cathay Pacific mainly utilizes the self-check in kiosk at Pearson Airport in Toronto for this particular flight, with limited counters and staff to assist passengers. Bag drop line was for the most part unorganized and some of the ground staff did not have the usual good attitude as one would expect from CX. Cabin crew service was satisfactory but slightly rushed on this flight, making it feel less personal that normal. Flight left Toronto half an hour late and arrived Hong Kong 15 minutes after schedule. Hong Kong to Bangkok on an older not furbished A330. Contrary the crew on the Toronto flight, the crew on this flight were pleasant and patient. To my surprise, on both sectors, the meal options were identical from my previous trip on the exact same itinerary back in February.

We requested to be seated together and they told us they would arrange it for us. This was a lie. By the time we got to the gate to check we were told they would not be able to arrange the seating so we could sit together because they would not request to swap another solo flyer to consider swapping with one of us. As an anxious flyer this airline definitely is worth avoiding. Uncompromising. Dispassionate and rude. After being lied to several times by the airline with what would be a reasonable request I highly recommend taking another airline. In terms of feedback and dispute resolution.

"""the trip back was awful""",Managed the flight out ok but the trip back was awful. To start with Hong Kong being a relatively new airport we thought would be good - nothing but plastic seats to sit on and very large windows (30ft high at a guess) which acted like cold air waterfalls. We were cold and there was no heating we could detect. Cold on the plane as well - we travelled all the way back with our winter coats on. Then came the message that they did not have sufficient evening meals on board so sitting at the rear of the plane we had a breakfast instead - which was not good shall we say. At breakfast time we declined the meal (once was enough) and waited until we arrived at Manchester for some food. I have travelled with Cathay Pacific before when I was working and had business class seats and had no complaints. CP have in my estimation gone way back in standard.

We were expecting good quality, fresh and well equipped planes on our trip to and from Australia. Instead we found ourselves in old, obsolete, and dirty planes with super old seats and monitors. What was most appaling though was the fact than on both our trips the pillows provided appeared used. On the way to Australia the pillow was covered in someone's hair, on the way back it was dirty with powder or foundation. My husband's pillows had some dark spots and smelled. Upon complaining the staff was very apologetic but not surprised at either of the occasions. The seats are very small and there's extremely limited legroom - my husband, who is over 190 cm high didn't fit into the sit, it never happened before on planes on such long distances.

"""the attention to detail is superb""","After extensive delays with no communication from ground staff, we boarded our Bangkok to Singapore flight. There were about 60 of us total on an Airbus 350 that held five times that many people, so everyone had plenty of room to spread out. The 350 is a great aircraft, and it took me less than 5 minutes on board to figure out that I wanted my next trans pacific flight on one of these-they're quiet, spacious, and high tech. From the reclining seats that slide forward to make life easier on those behind you to the headrests which seemingly defy the laws of physics (they fold in-and out) the attention to detail is superb. The tray tables have a tablet stand, and the personal space in general had more functions than I could figure out. Cathay service onboard really doesn't need another glowing review-it was superb as expected. Meals were excellent and served promptly, trays were also collected promptly as well after the meal. The inflight entertainment is really top notch, though the screen is a bit jumpy as you scroll through. For those of us with terrible hearing, the volume is adequate without being turned up too high-it helps that the plane is very quiet at cruise altitude.

The menu option read exactly ""Mushroom fusilli and tomato concasse"", however it was just one small mushroom sliced 5 times garnishing pasta with a tomato sauce. I believe ""tomato concasse"" would normally be crushed tomatoes. No sign of that. The menu option was, Stir fried egg noodles with chicken, vegetables and 2 dumplings. However the amount of chicken and vegetables could be held on one tablespoon. It was essentially just stir fried noodles. The dumplings were small but good. I understand I was flying economy and wasn't expecting Haute Cuisine, however using fancy words to describe something so substandard is just wrong and leads to disappointment when other menu options could have been chosen. The wine was nice but one small glass was less than some other airlines serve. Other aspects of the trip were really good including the plane and service etc. However it would have been good to be able to select a seat and not have one automatically allocated as someone taller than 6 foot could be uncomfortable in a 78 cm pitched seat.",1,6,M Jenkins,2018-03-10,no,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,Hong Kong to London,March 2018,3,1,5,5,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

"""focus on details was truly amazing""","Flew Bangkok to Toronto via Hong Kong. Bangkok Check-In was smooth and professional. Staff informed me of a possible seat upgrade and asked for my seat preference if upgraded. Cathay's lounge in Bangkok was fairly chaotic, as a British Airways flight was delayed and hence resulted in a higher volume of number of people. Bangkok to Hong Kong on a 3-class A330-300. The flight was full and quick, flying time was 2 hrs 9 minutes instead of usual 2 hrs 30-45 minutes. Crew were mostly Thai and were extremely pleasant over meal service, showing Thai hospitality and Cathay's core value. Otherwise, flight was uneventful and the plane arrived Hong Kong earlier than scheduled. I had booked an itinerary that would require an overnight layover in Hong Kong. Heading to the lounge, the staff was welcoming and informed me the lounge would close at 12.30am. I visited 3 lounges and I found the Pier to be the most suitable for a nap as there is a nap area. I returned to the lounge at 5.30am, when it reopened, prior to my flight to Toronto. Hong Kong to Toronto on CX828. Once again a full flight in Economy and I was upgraded to Premium Economy for the flight. Seat next to me was empty.

Flight departed Hong Kong slightly late but arrived Toronto half an hour ahead of schedule. The crew on this flight were pleasant, offering several round of drinks throughout the flight. However, despite all the positives, the biggest let down on this trip was catering. Especially on the Premium Economy sector, I chose the western option for lunch and the mashed potatoes were soggy and grainy. Dinner was standard, but for the most part, meal was similar to that of Economy's. Although the plus is getting actual metal cutlery instead of plastic ones. Overall, an average experience.

Same herring bone layout as the B777, which I think is the best layout as all the seats have aisle access and means you're not having to step over people to get out of your seat. The seat in design terms is pretty much the same as the old product, which is a great, why change something if it ain't broke, but obviously with a better resolution screen, updated handset, and a couple more storage holes. However, my only gripe about the A350 is that the headphone sockets now only takes a 2 pin adaptor of which strangely one is 2.5mm and the other 3.5mm. Hence my Bose QC35 no longer work - first world problems right? Cathay or Airbus please work with Bose to sort this out! I noted on this flight that the crew did not give out the full evening meal i.e. missed out dessert and cheese board.

However this time I thought I'd try out Cathay's Premium Economy Class on their A350-900 from London Gatwick. While at Gatwick's South terminal and being a One World Sapphire member I got to use BA's lounge and the First Class lounge at that! To be honest I was really disappointed and not a patch on even Cathay's business lounge at Heathrow. Moving onto the flight. The new premium economy was superb! The new darker colour scheme made the seat feel cosier, modern and sleek. The seat was comfy, in fact it was the first time I've actually had a proper sleep on a premium economy seat. The noise levels are definitely lower than the B777 and certainly noticed my skin and throat didn't feel dry with the new air filteration system. The updated IFE with a wider screen than the B777 is probably one of the best on any airline and, in my opinion, far better than compared to Emirates. It was easier to navigate through and just worked (a month before, I took a return Emirates A380 flight from LGW to Dubai and on both legs the IFE stopped working!). My main gripe with the new A350 is that the headphone sockets now only take a 2 pin adaptor where one pin is 2.5mm and the other 3.5mm - hence my Bose QC35's adaptor no longer fits which was really annoying. I even enquired with Bose to see if they had a suitable adaptor which they didn't - so really bummed about that - if Cathay can provide a suitable adaptor I'd be really happy!

However as this a 16-hour flight, the crew provided a second meal at the middle of the flight, in the addition that many passengers have consumed their cup noodles before the second meal.

I had to insist that I had to use the toilet before the flight attendant would let me pass. The service, by contrast, on my flight in the other direction via Singapore Airlines was perfection, the reason why they are consistently at the top of the list.

One selects a particular seat for a reason and it is rather odd they ignored my partner as we were seated behind each other. The cabin crew hardly smiled and food from a supermarket would be better than what was served. A starter of dinner before landing was a plate of cut fruit. This in incredibly mean. The main (confit of duck) was as cold as ice. Cathay is going through a hard time but by serving supermarket type food they are telling loyal customer like me to look elsewhere.

I've learned today that CP struggle greatly to deal with difficulties. My premium economy flight was originally scheduled for 17:15, to Perth via Hong Kong, but was subject to repeated delays until my connection was under threat. The people in the lengthy queue at the desk informed me the flight was unlikely to leave and that staff were rebooking people to other flights, even other airlines. I waited for more than two hours in the queue, eventually to be told that there were two options available . I could take the first leg in the 5 hour delayed original flight, with no onward connection available until 24 hours after the original, resulting in a full day delay. My other option was to fly another airline, to Sydney via Singapore, with a lengthy wait there until a connection to Perth, the latter leg in economy and around 14 hours delay. No upgrades were offered, despite those delays and the inconvenience. I asked about being upgraded and was very reluctantly offered business class on the first leg only, on the first option. That, apparently, is the very best they could do for me. During the conversation I was invited to explore other routes and options myself online if I thought I could do better, told that I should appreciate that they hadn't deliberately planned this disruption and informed that they were dealing with lots of people in the same situation - as though I was somehow not appreciating fully their problems and being rather selfish in the circumstances.

Upon arriving in Hong Kong Cathay Pacific employees reassured us we would be on our booked flight. To our dismay, Cathay Pacific failed to expedite our airport transit time and our connecting flight left without us. There was no attempt made to help us with catching the connection and no apology given. We also had an arranged pickup in Bangkok for our scheduled arrival time, which was no longer available to us. Our original flight from Vancouver to Hong Kong was a scheduled 14 hour flight time and was the longest, most drawn out, disappointing flight in our lives.

The real star of this show was the A350. The aircraft was new, quieter than the 777 and the Cathay seats in economy were very comfortable. For a change, I did not feel sore or have a backache after the almost 15 hour flight to HKG. I was even able to get some sleep here and there- a first for me. Legroom is also decent. The seat back pocket issue is a real thing - which others have brought up. It didn't bother me as much after a while. The crew on both the flights from and to Newark, seemed to have a problem with the cabin lighting. There were occasions when the cabin was pitch dark, it would suddenly get super bright and then go back down to dim - for no reason. Service was generally efficient, the crew were always present throughout the flight and were pleasant enough when engaged. The large touchscreen IFE system is responsive, the airshow and onboard cameras great (during the day) but I felt the content available could have been expanded greatly. It seemed somewhat limited for a flight that long. The catering on all sectors seems to have not changed all that much over the years that I have flown with CX on this route. The tray is small, the portions are just adequate and sound better on the printed menu card than they taste. No amenity kits provided. A small, self-serve snack bar was set up in the galley for the long haul to HKG. From there to SIN, it was an A330 with the last generation seats, which were as comfortable but there seemed to be less legroom. A full flight with a similar experience with meals and crew.

Boarding was professional. Then everything went downhill. Indifferent crew and dreadful food. One option of starter with a salad but no dressing was served with it. Rice with main was very hard. Crew did not offer to top up drinks or offered more bread. I asked for a mid flight snack and the noodle was still hard so asked for rhe burger which was actually very good. Breakfast option was also excellent but I was not offered coffee or hot drinks and for some reason I was ignored by cabin member who served people around me. The cabin service director, who after I complained about the robotic, unprofessional and indifferent service, came to see if all was ok, was horrified I was ignored. Seat is spacious but very very hard so best to ask for another duvet as use a a mattress. It does wonders.

"""bit skeptical about Cathay""","Hong Kong to Paris CDG. I am a little bit skeptical about Cathay. It is clearly a top airline and perhaps their CDG-HKG-CDG route is not highly strategic. HKG airport lounge first class lounge is far away from boarding gate. No announcement was made of the flight delay, and as you are not escorted to the plane (this service is standard procedure for some airlines) you end up waiting before a closed boarding gate! Luckily there was a closer Business class lounge (named the bridge I think), which proved perhaps more comfortable than the First class one. I decided to have them wait for me and didn’t move until they called my name (I was naughty but it was very late). The seat is extremely comfortable. Once transformed into your bed, it is very large.  A special mention for the pyjama. Flight attendants were very nice. The night ambiance of the plane was standard and I missed the privacy of Air France curtains or Singapore airline sliding doors.

The menus were distributed, but only one to be shared each 3 passengers (saving on paper?). Food was boring looking and not in a great quantity. Bread not very well heated. What is worst is that they serve filtered water from jars. Breakfast of congee or eggs with sausage. I believe that CX catering is most boring and predictable. Service was efficient but very cold. Next time I would consider flying with EK or QR.

"""my worst flight experience""","Vancouver to Kolkata via Hong Kong. I was also carrying a lot of chocolates that everyone was planning to use at my sister's wedding. I chose Cathay Pacific because of a 24-hour flight to CCU. Only 2 stops, but it happened to be my worst flight experience ever! Flight from Vancouver was delayed, and connecting flight was missed. Cathay informed us that the quickest connection was to be a delay of 24-hours, and that via Singapore with one more stop. Thus, a 24 hour flight was now 48-hour flight. I missed my sister’s wedding, due to the sheer mismanagement of Cathay. Even after informing them about my urgency, they did not offer me a different route! When I checked online, I found a connection to Kolkata available which allowed me to reach earlier! On mentioning that to the ground staff, they informed us, it is not from a partner flight; hence they cannot offer that flight! Ground staff did not know how to apply for a Hong Kong permit. Hence, we did not get a Visa, and had to stay in the airport lounge for one whole night. The lounge did not have a place to sleep. In-flight, the flight attendants could not provide me the meal I asked for. They offered me a vegetarian meal, when I specifically asked for a non-vegetarian chicken meal. Thus, during this experience with Cathay, I did get the flights I booked the tickets for, did not get the food I asked for, nor did I get a place to sleep at night. The staff and customer service was also not cooperative at all. The customer support was very negligent, and did not reply favorably to my request. I am a student, and strive hard to make to ends meet. I do not have any extra money to waste on an irresponsible airline, who does not try to attend to their customers.

"""service and style has deteriorated""","My first experiences with Cathay Pacific were in economy more than 10 years ago on flights from YVR to Bangkok and NYC. They were such excellent experiences that they became the Holy Grail for good service. However I didn't travel to the Far East again until recently. We booked Premium Economy expecting our previous service to be surpassed. I would still recommend Cathay based on reliability and the competence and courtesy of all their ground and air crews. However the space and meals in Premium Economy left a lot to be desired. I realize that a lot has changed in 10 years but recent Premium Economy experiences on Lufthansa, Air Canada and BA to Europe were much better. The food was awful particularly on the HKG to YVR leg. The menu promised a selection of several wines but only two were on hand and the white was warm. The food was wretched and I'm not one to complain. It was overcooked, cheaply made, unimaginative and served in awkward plastic containers. Absolutely nothing premium about it and if economy is worse then something is amiss with their customer service strategy. I wonder if inconsistency is a problem because we could only book economy of their flight to Hanoi where we were surprised to be served a meal at all and it was better than the ones on the long haul premium flights. The seats were not roomy and the look and feel of the cabin was grubby. The hard-working and pleasant crew spent an unusual amount of time flogging their Duty Free products which made us feel like we were on EasyJet at times. In short, service and style has deteriorated from past experiences. Another factor may have been the over-zealous and officious crew director.",1,6,B Wilkinson,2017-12-15,yes,Premium Economy,Couple Leisure,Hong Kong to Vancouver via Ho Chi Minh City,December 2017,4,1,5,5,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

The seats were comfortable although the seat pockets on the seats were directly connected with fabric and no internal plastic, meaning whenever you or somebody else went into the seat pocket, the person in front felt it quite a lot and it was frustrating while trying to sleep. The meal options werent great, considering it was a flight from England to Asia, you'd expect there to be British style options as well as Asian, not on this flight. On dinner service the crew were rude, ""what do you want"" I understand their first language is not english, but being a flight from an English speaking country you'd expect there to be a little better knowledge.

The seats have a rigid divider, so when I needed to exit from my window seat I could not get past the man lying all the way back in the row in front and refusing to lift his seat for me. For all that I arrived in OK shape and had a safe and comfortable trip. Check in was efficient and friendly, I was a priority client needing a wheelchair and all of that was fine, albeit with a few reminders to the crew that a wheelchair was required on arrival in HK. I needed oxygen half way across, due to the long walk back from the loo and the struggle under the seat as described above, as I have a respiratory condition, the air was thin and I  was severely oxygen depleted, and the crew were marvelous about that.

Ground staff in Vancouver assured me I would have time to make the connection in Hong Kong due to the shorter flight time than usual (12.25hrs on the YVR-HKG sector compared to the usual 13.00+ hrs). I was skeptical due to my past experiences with this particular itinerary. I had no choice but to keep my old connecting flight. As a Marco Polo Club Silver Member, I was entitled to use the First and Business Class lounge in Vancouver. The YVR lounge is definitely superior to some in Hong Kong due to less crowds and quality staff. The serenity and assuring gestures from the lounge staff calmed me down and depleted my anxiety about my connecting flight. Flight to Hong Kong on a Boeing 777. Seat was very spacious with several storage compartments even in Economy Class. Inflight meals were standard as per Cathay's long haul service and cabin crew worked hard to meet every need to passengers. Arrived Hong Kong an hour later than initially scheduled, only to find out my original connection was delayed by 2 hours. Although slightly devastated, I was relieved as I no longer had to run to make the flight. The Bridge lounge in Hong Kong had adequate space and serenity for me to relax and rest prior to my connecting flight. Cathay Pacific has excelled with their lounges, whether it be the space or amenities/facilities. Flight to Bangkok boarded on time with the new departure time but took almost an hour to obtain clearance from Air Traffic Control due to the busy period at Hong Kong Airport. Ultimately, flight departed Hong Kong 3 hours late and arrived Bangkok almost 4 hours late due to congestion at Bangkok Airport, resulting in a holding of almost 30 minutes. I was upgraded to Premium Economy for the Airbus A350 flight and the seat seemed a bit tighter than the ones found on the 777s, yet the amenities and more updated IFE made up for the flaws of the seat.

"""certainly far from the worst""","Mumbai to San Francisco via Hong Kong in economy and when possible I prefer Cathay Pacific primarily because Hong Kong is probably one of the best connecting airports. The airport is well designed, security checks are fast and reasonable. And if you have a long connection, there is a free visa on arrival, which lets you explore Hong Kong city. On occasion, I book a 12 H transit halt so I can relax in HK for a bit. While the service and amenities aren't the best, especially when compared to airlines like Emirates, it isn't the worst either. The food is fairly good. They carry one Asian, one Western and one veggie (usually pasta) entree. The dessert is almost always haagen-dazs vanilla ice-cream with a mini-chocolate bar. (Although once I did get Mövenpick) As a frequent traveler on the airline - it does get boring to get the same dessert and same choices. You can almost start predicting the menu after a bit.  If you are a whiskey person they have Chivas Regal 12 on their carts.  They also have a specially developed beer, designed to taste great in a pressurized cabin, called Betsy. Named after Cathay's first airplane - the beer is actually pretty good. The entertainment system is good. They have a very good selection of the latest English and Chinese movies, TV shows and TED talks. I find their short film section to be particularly interesting. I usually listen to classical music on long flights - and in this department their selection excels. There is usually a selection of newspapers like the New York Times and The South China Morning Post apart from leading newspapers in Mandarin just before you board. Their in-flight magazine Discovery makes for a very engaging read.  The online booking and web check-in interface is very dated, and occasionally buggy. The interface of their frequent flier program isn't the best either, but on the plus side, they do ship a physical card to your postal address - which is a nice touch. I hope they improve their technology soon. A big sore-point for me personally is the lack on Wifi on the A330 and B777 fleet. The newer planes (A350) supposedly have Wifi - however I have never personally been on those flights.

Even though just a 2-hour flight, a full lunch service including steak and two other options for main course, and started with drinks (excellent selection of wines, including a well selected Marlborough Sav Blanc). Seats are herringbone lie-flats in a 1-2-1 row with lots of room and storage spaces, a large flat screen offers a wide range of entertainment options that can be viewed from the minute you sit down - and during takeoff and landing. The seat's design has excellent privacy features, so if you are in one of the center seats, you don't have to see the other center seat occupant, and all seats are shielded from aisle traffic and views of seats from across the aisle. the lavs at the front are large, windowed and perfectly placed (not at the very front which would require navigating through the galley and resting crew members). The A350 features on-board WiFi though didn't use it. The cabin felt roomier and more quiet than other wide-bodys in CX's fleet.

"""the booking class was the biggest caveat""","Flew Cathay Pacific from Zurich to Bangkok via Hong Kong. Quality of the flight was good, the crew were friendly, food was ok (but not outstanding) and the special extra was the noodle soup that could be ordered as a snack anytime. The deciding factor to book this airline, was the 30kg baggage allowance, otherwise only given by by few other airlines (Thai Airways, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines are known to me). The other reason was the price. Booking early meant that we got the cheapest booking class, so the price was low, not lower than other airlines for their cheapest booking class. However the booking class was the biggest caveat. It's this bad, that I will never book this airline again. The problem is like this. When you get one of the the two lowest booking classes, you can't select your seat before check-in. When check-in opens 48 hours before the flight, there is a mouse race for the very last seats that haven't been reserved yet, as all other booking classes can select their seats before check-in. For us this meant that you either can't check-in online at all (as there are no seats to choose anymore), as it happened on the first way. Or you can select only separated seats for a couple travelling together, as it happened on the way back. The seats for the second leg we only got in transit, even the check-in staff at the counter couldn't give us any seats and of course we were not sitting together.

Inflight entertainment options were very good, and I was pleased that the Ed Sheeran album ""Divide"", a personal favorite of mine, was offered. Pushback commenced and the A330 was able to take off.

"""altered my meal request""","Auckland to London via Hong Kong. At the time of booking their website had glitches that even their call centre staff struggled creating a booking. This was annoying and cumbersome. The call centre staff member that I spoke with was irritable and short in his responses. It became so bad that I asked to speak to his manager and only then did he become moderately professional. Then very to my huge disappointment he had altered my meal request to a special meal not of my choosing. The plane staff exchanged these unfortunate mistakes with only faint annoyance. Their newer aircraft was great. Comfy, spacious and good service. The older Boeing 777 was less comfortable and the staff were much less generous especially in regards to disallowing me to board with a car seat and umbrella stroller.

The space is good but the seat itself is way more uncomfortable than a low cost airline seat with no recline at all. I hope they will phase out all these seats soon! As always in internal Asia routes, food very average quality and boring. Pasta or pork with rice. Same desserts as always: Haagen Dazs icecream. Don't they think that their valued frequent flyers could be bored on having the same dessert in every single CX flight? Entertainment choice as always not the best but good enough.

"""It was a horrible service""","Melbourne to Colombo via Hong Kong. We boarded as usual on time. We made ourselves comfortable and sat within the aircraft for over 30min without any information provided by the crew. At last the captain made an announcement that there are technical flaws with the aircraft and that he has no choice but to cancel the flight. So all passengers were taken off the flight and once in the ground we were informed that they intend to transfer us to a Qantas flight to depart 3 hours later. I had a 4 hour transit at Hong kong prior to my next flight to Colombo and when I mentioned this to the ground staff they were quiet assuring that I would be there on time to catch my next flight. 3 hours passed and they picked a few passengers ""randomly"" to have the previledge of flying the Qantas flight while the rest of us kept sitting in patience. When inquired as to what is going on the ground staff replied ""sir we have got permission only for limited passengers and so we picked a few randomly."" So what happens to the rest? The answer was that the rest would be flying through Cathay Pacific in their next scheduled departure which was 8 hours after our original departure time. No lounges were provided, just food coupons. Then time passed and we were at last on board a flight, landed in Hong kong having missed my connecting flight. We were informed that all passengers to Colombo will be flown to Singapore and then from Singapore to Colombo via Sri lanka Airlines.

"""I would recommend Cathay""","Singapore to Bangkok having managed to get a discounted fare on this route.  At Changi, I checked in using the FAST check in counters-seems like Cathay has moved to self check-in for almost all its passengers(with the exception of priority passengers-Marco Polo Club, oneWorld members, etc.), although there were staff on hand to assist passengers in checking in, and they were helpful. Flight was delayed due to late arrival of aircraft. Boarding efficient, cabin had a comfortable feel and the seat was as good as those found on the economy class of SQ and TG A350s, but the charging port was hard to access, although not a problem for me, being a 2hr+ flight. Cathay provided the passengers with exterior camera views of the aircraft through the IFE, with a tail and front camera provided. Cabin crew were attentive, if robotic at times. However, the onboard drinks selection was a bit narrow, and the food served was dismal, comparable to my domestic flight on Air China.

"""most shoddy plane ride ever""","I've been flying with Cathay for 26 years. My family and I are all Marco Polo members ranging from green to gold. Today I waited 9.5 hours at the airport for my flight from Sydney to Hong Kong (CX110, now CX162), and now I'm told it'll be another 30 mins wait. I understand that HK is experiencing bad weather and I was told the plane had a mechanical problem but there has been problems with the way they dealt with this issue. They never made an announcement about the cancelled flight until well after the anticipated boarding time. When we approached the front desk we were told that the flight is cancelled and we were transferred to a later flight. Staff said if they made an announcement then it would create a commotion. It makes no logical sense. I said lots of people are probably still waiting for the announcement. Fast forward to the plane ride: the most shoddy plane ride ever. I've flown with many airlines - even down to tiny airlines like Air Timor. This has got to be the worst plane I've flown. The backs of our seats could not be controlled and went up and down just by leaning on it. We were shifted to the back for take off and the TV did not work (I have to say the inflight manager was nice about it). The cold water button in the bathroom didn't work. I saw staff roll their eyes after talking to passengers. As I was put in the last seat on the plane on this service, I also heard all the gossip about passengers from the staff at the back. I have booked 3 more flights with Cathay in the coming 2 weeks and I'm really dreading it.",0,2,W Cheung,2017-07-20,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,Sydney to Hong kong,July 2017,3,3,1,2,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
"""a less than comfortable experience""","I hadn't flown Cathay Pacific for a number of years, but I always remembered them being a very comfortable airline offering a better than average product. As a disclaimer, my airline of choice for this route (Los Angeles to Singapore via Hong Kong) has always been Singapore Airlines, so I realize I may have high standards. However, I'm still just an average economy traveler who simply expects to be taken care of on long flights. The trip out from LAX to SIN was a bit treacherous due to mechanical problems. This, I understand, but the way the airline handled it was - I'd say - less than satisfactory. I had a scheduled 01.25 departure that was delayed 11 hours. I was not made aware of the fact until 19.00 the night of my flight. The reason for the delay was the plane had engine problems when it was leaving HK (for LAX) and had to turn around, but what made it extremely confusing was that the airline somehow did not make the delay public knowledge (Google Flights, Flight Tracker and others had the flight noted as an on time departure), so there was quite a bit of confusion. I decided to arrive at the airport at my normal time (~2 hrs prior) at which point the delay was confirmed. I asked if they could put me on another flight of any other airline because I was going to SIN for a family emergency and I was told there were no available seats. They offered to put me up in a hotel which I accepted and gave me meal vouchers that didn't cover the cost of a single dish (for either dinner or breakfast - $25 and $15 respectively). The next morning upon check-in, I was told that my flights out were not full because they had moved many passengers to other flights/airlines - this really irritated me because I was told there were no available seats the night before. Once I finally arrived in HK (11.5 hours later than expected), my flight to SIN was delayed an additional 4 hours. At this point, I went to the CX counter and kindly asked for a pass to the lounge so I could rest and shower, since I'd already been delayed in my travels. They said they couldn't help me because they'd already compensated me in LA with the hotel stay. This irritated me; I understand that the airline may feel that I've been compensated, but I don't understand what it would have 'cost them' to provide a little extra customer service to a tired traveler asking to rest as a result of their delays. CX is based in HK and has multiple lounges in the airport. I suppose I was asking too much, but it was frustrating nonetheless. Both flights out felt both rushed and inadequately supplied (in terms of meals and personnel) making for a less than comfortable experience for such long flights. A route that normally takes me about 22-24 hours to complete (door to door) ended up taking about 37 hours and the overall experience left me with a slightly less than stellar opinion. I have to say, the flights back were on schedule and slightly better, but the overall experience was still not what I remember, nor what I'm currently used to. I would recommend CX because I know my initial experience was a bit of an anomaly, however, it does not change the fact that I am/was disappointed and wish the delays were handled better.",0,6,G Anderson,2017-07-12,yes,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,Los Angeles to Singapore via Hong Kong,July 2017,2,2,2,4,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

While the configuration decreased seat width, especially when it was converted to a bed, it was still cozy and comfortable. Service was a lot warmer and prompt.

"""made me feel very inferior""","Auckland to London Heathrow via Hong Kong. On this flight I was seated in Premium Economy Row 33A. Boarding at Hong Kong was unorganized and chaotic, firstly being advised boarding was from gate 2, then later advised it was changed to gate 29. No announcements were made until boarding over 1 hour later than expected (which I find puzzling having flown multiple International flights with other airlines in the past 22 years). When boarding did commence again no boarding procedure as with other airlines which normally call for First and loyalty passengers boarding first or passengers with limited mobility and parents with young children. There were lines marked Business, Economy and it seemed most people queued in the Business line (which surprised me there were so many Business seats on this flight). When finally boarded 1 hour late the Captain announced the late departure was due to our plane being towed between gates, then having lost its departure slot had to wait with heavy number of aircraft ahead of us from China. This would have been perfectly acceptable if passengers were advised in the departure lounge. Onboard seats were good but not as comfortable as the flight from Auckland to Hong Kong on board CX198 which was an A350-900 (35G) However on the flight from Hong Kong to Heathrow we encountered problems in using the toilet as the toilet for Premium Economy passengers was situated in front of seats 32 H/K but the only access was by walking in front of 4 passengers seated in row 30 D-G which upset them due there being insufficient space to do this and resulted in fellow Premium Economy class passengers tripping over their out stretched legs and belongings. I am amazed that when designing an aircraft passenger accessibility is not taken into account and if they did they must have used a very small person to bypass very small upright people to gain access to this toilet or installed it with the view that only passengers seated on the right side of the aircraft would use it. I resorted to using the toilet in Business class as I had observed other PE passengers doing, however a flight attendant was waiting as I exited the toilet cubicle and commenced to give me a very severe dressing down who informed me I had no right being there and made me feel very inferior. I asked where I should go (I would like to point out at this stage that I am a 71 year old female with bladder problems) I was told it was preferable to use the toilets back near row 45 in Economy. This meant I had to queue up with the remaining 62 passengers seated in this Economy section of the aircraft. Not very satisfactory considering we had paid almost double the price of an Economy class ticket! Apart from this I found the Entertainment choices were really disappointing especially compared to the Entertainment on Emirates. There was very little choice of music or films and most were aimed at Asian audiences, in spite of a large proportion of the aircrafts passengers being European. Food was good but not brilliant, very little was offered in terms of pre dinner drinks. Would I fly or recommend this airline again, probably not given my experience and very disappointed after spending more than we normally do on airline tickets.

"""the legroom is great""","First, the boarding gate is gate 1 in Hong Kong, which is very close to the exit of the customs. The flight is on time, arriving at the gate of Incheon airport at around 5.44am. The flight is quite smooth. The seat is quite comfortable. Note that this A333 economy seats have a fixed shell. The seatback is fixed. So the seat cannot recline backwards. Instead, the seat kind of slides down. I quite like this idea. It means that the monitor will never be too close to you and you will not be annoyed by the one in front of you. The legroom is great. I fell asleep easily before taking off. About an hour later, the meal is served. I was a bit disappointed that the meal was not an ordinary full size meal. There is no choice of main course. Usually there are two for passengers to choose from. The food is put inside a rectangle paper box, the box is quite nice actually. There is a small bowl containing a few slices of fruits, orange, kiwi, pineapple and one more. There is a sandwich with something like mayonnaise, salad. And there is a biscuit. That is all. I do anticipate more, but probably this is an overnight short flight, 3 hours and 40 minutes, departing at 1am. So Cathay thinks it is better to give you a light meal with mostly vegetables. I would be happier if it was a full meal. The inflight entertainment was excellent. It offers a great variety of HK, Asia and western movies, TV programmes and music.

When I asked why didn't you warn us that we need a transit visa, the lady working at the Check In counter said this: ""I blame you for not knowing this piece of information"". But who would have known we (me and my friend) would need a visa just to transit in Vancouver for 2 hours? Apparently we are not the only ones who were refused to board because of this reason. As a result, we had to pay 200$ each person to go on a different plane. They put us a ""Wait list"" because all the flights were over-booked for 2 weeks. So we had to stay and sleep at the airport and luckily they let us board after 18 hours.

"""Catering is not CX's strong point""","I thought flying Cathay Pacific economy on an ultra long haul flight 3 weeks after returning from a similar distance in J would be a huge disappointment, but life (and CX) holds numerous surprises. Being a Marco Polo Club member allowed me to check in my entire family using the priority lanes on both outbound and return. The advantage was seen in the Manila to Hong Kong route where the check in queues at NAIA 3 seemed to snake around forever. Staff in MNL were courteous enough. Departing MNL through gate 111 was extremely chaotic. I would suggest that one hang around one of the pay-in lounges or in one of the (few) coffee shops outside the gate until the last minute. The MNL-HKG leg was the usual, rushed ultra short flight with absolutely no catering worth mentioning consisting of an overheated pastry, ANZAC cookie and boxed juice drink. PAL serves hot meals on their MNL-HKG flights even in economy, I wonder why a carrier such as CX still continues to think that this budget airline move is worthy of a 5-star airline? Same experience on the return HKG-MNL leg. The long haul product proved to be a pleasant surprise. The seats were more comfortable than expected and the 3-3-3 configuration does a lot for the perception of space in the back cabin. Catering is not CX's strong point, but the meals served were actually edible. The snack option of cup noodles were very tasty and the galley snack tray was always full. In-flight staff were pretty good with ready smiles and service. Good and frequent drink runs were made throughout the 16 hour journey both ways. I would say that it was a pleasant surprise through the long haul leg. I am on the fence regarding the IFE choices, but the hardware is pretty good if you bring your own earphones (the one provided by CX is rubbish).

At Vancouver check-in the lady who checked me in was cheerful and funny, contrary to my previous experiences while checking in in Vancouver. I was initially supposed to fly in Premium Economy Class for the entire itinerary until I was notified of a seat change on my flight from Vancouver to Hong Kong. An upgrade to Business Class was definitely a true blessing on a transpacific flight and I couldn't be more impressed with the service I received. The Cathay Pacific lounge in Vancouver provides such a serenade prior to a long-haul flights, where the staff were so accommodating. The crew were prompt to respond to requests and made me feel welcome and comfortable. The seat didn't feel too different from the regular Premium Economy seat in terms of width, however, when turned into a flat bed, provided one of the best sleeps I've had among other Business Class I have experienced. I appreciated the details put into the seat,  adequate storage and the mirror in one of the compartments, and light at one of the storage areas. Despite all the positives, I felt indifferent towards the catering. Though the main courses and drinks were great, there were components of the meals that left me underwhelmed. Arrived Hong Kong on schedule and made my way to The Wing lounge. Staff were enthusiastic to help. Hong Kong to Bangkok in a bulkhead seat in Premium Economy Class. Despite my love towards the bulkhead seat on Cathay's Economy, I was at fault for selecting this bulkhead in Premium Economy. The fact that the personal screen couldn't be used during take-off and landing made for a very boring flight for me, again, not at all the airline's fault. Since it was a regional flight, meal service was similar to that of Economy Class, and it was a standard breakfast meal which satisfied me. Crew service on this short flight left a bit to be desired, but since it was a rather early morning flight, the cabin itself seemed dry. Bags were among the first ones out in Bangkok and I was out of the airport within 30 minutes of arriving. On-time departure and arrival on both flights.

The quality of meals and service have not advanced as far, this year, as Emirates, Etihad, and Turkish — the airlines I have most used of late. But my biggest gripe with Cathay is with their customer service. I flew home to the US to care for ailing relatives. I had bought a very economical economy seat and I knew the ticket was non-refundable and that there would be a fee should I have to extend my stay but the $650 Cathay wanted in order for me to change my return flight by one week was more than I paid for half my round-trip ticket. I told their phone rep the family's medical reasons I needed to stay, but it made no difference. When I suggested that I might as well look for a one-way flight cheaper than Cathay's change fee, she said only that I should call them if I wasn't going to use my ticket. ""Why?"" I inquired. ""There's no refund, right."" She replied that no, there was no refund, but that that would be the polite thing to do. Cathay Pacific has not been very polite to me.

The food was okay, not as good as the outbound, the starter salad was a bit bland, I enjoyed my lamb and mash main, but my wife found the halibut needed more sauce. Dessert was Hagan Das ice cream. The choice of drinks were standard Economy, which actually wasn't bad. I did have a Chivas Regal with ginger but then stuck to water. Breakfast was either scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon and potatoes or a dim sum set, I had the former and it was okay, nothing special. There were plenty of snacks available throughout thr flight such as cookies, crisps, chocolate and cup noodles - just help yourself at the galley at the rear of the plane. In flight entertainment was excellent with some quite recent films, such as Star Wars Rogue One and Sing, which have just been released on DVD.

"""quality is still top notch""","Last-minute trip to Seoul from Bangkok via Hong Kong. Since the trip was immediate, I was unable to get seats together for my mother, my sister, and I during the Online Check-In process. At Suvarnabhumi Airport (Bangkok), I asked the ground staff if she was able to move us together, and right away, though a little robotic, she managed to find us a row of seats together. The aircraft used on the Bangkok - Hong Kong sector was a Boeing 777-300ER. Due to a late inbound aircraft from Hong Kong, there was a 45-minute delay departing Bangkok and 20-minute delay arriving Hong Kong. Crew worked very hard during meal service, working around pretty demanding passengers and a short flight time. Transit in Hong Kong was uneventful, as most of the duty free area was already closed and the final flights of the night (at least Cathay Pacific connections to Europe/North America) were boarding. Hong Kong to Seoul on a refurbished A330-300. Flight departed early and arrived 25 minutes early into Seoul. There was a demanding passenger (specifically a tour guide) right next to us and she was demanding things from the cabin crew at the most inconvenient of time (right before take off, she was asking for immigration forms; and right before landing, she was asking water for her water bottle). The crew dealing with her declined her requests professionally but eventually fulfilled her requests after take-off/landing. Bags came promptly and we got out of the airport fairly quickly. Overall, the usual long-haul Cathay service scaled down (since both sectors were short-haul flights), yet the quality is still top notch.

Due to a mechanical issue with the aircraft, the flight from Vancouver was delayed by approximately 5 and a half hours. Check-in in Vancouver was a frenzy, with ground staff breaking the news to the passengers at half past midnight while trying to rebook as many passengers onto other flights (which were also extremely full, due to Spring Break). I have once stated this in one of my reviews, but it seems as if the ground staff in Vancouver are deteriorating. I was given told to ""go home and come back at 4.30am in the morning"". Dull responses such as ""We don't even know if the flight will leave. If the plane has a problem, we'll have to cancel the flight. But we won't know until 6.30am in the morning."" It was 1 in the morning, like how am I supposed to get home at this time? I was completely stressed out and realized I was going to miss my connecting flight to Bangkok. Nonetheless, I made my way to the lounge where the staff were much more understanding and tried their best to get us settled in before our flight. I was offered a bowl of noodle soup and blankets. Hence, I was able to grab a 4-hour nap before the flight was announced to be operational. I also managed to grab a shower before boarding which immensely helped me with my bitter mood from the night before. Vancouver to Hong Kong on the Oneworld livery aircraft. Crew was flawless and worked hard, non-stop, throughout the trans-Pacific flight, offering drinks and cup noodle every half an hour midflight. Arrived Hong Kong at almost noon time (originally scheduled for a 7am arrival) to an army of ground staff handling misconnections. I was rebooked onto the 8pm flight to Bangkok, and Cathay gave me a hotel room and a meal in the airport hotel as a compensation. The staff that assisted me offered every communication tool possible for me to communicate with my parents, who were waiting for me in Bangkok, as well as apologizing several times for the delay. I must say, although frustrated, I was impressed by how well all the staff in Hong Kong handled the misconnections, unlike the ones in Vancouver that weren't willing to help since they ""couldn't confirm if the flight was leaving or not.""

I was in the first row of the economy section so leg room was also partially restricted because of the bulkhead, but it also had virtually no recline and the seat back was almost like a piece of wood. The flight was almost 5 hours and was pretty uncomfortable. Not taking the bulkhead would have been better as I would have at least been able to stretch my legs under the seat in front.

However, I declined it as I didn’t want to lose my seat selection (aisle seat). It was nice to have been offered, though. Boarding of my original flight was then delayed by an hour without warning, due to ‘technical reasons’. This was poorly communicated to the hundreds of passengers waiting at the gate, until the original departure time had elapsed. We were then advised by word of mouth (not the public intercom) to come back to the gate in an hour. This created a lot of sense of uncertainty as to what was happening with our flight.

"""a run around from Cathay Pacific""","On 20th December 2016 my wife and I were booked to fly Johannesburg to Hong Kong on South African Airways (SAA). Thereafter and on separate tickets we were booked to fly first class on Cathay Pacific CX711 to Singapore departing 16h10. We checked in on line prior to departing Johannesburg and received our boarding passes and booked our luggage through to Singapore. In-flight delays resulted in the SAA flight landing at 15h14. A lady with a sign with our flight number and names was at the gate. She expedited us through security to the gate. We waited 20 minutes before the flight was called and then presented our passports at the first class queue - our passports were duly checked, the boarding pass was initialled and we were advised to wait for boarding. When attempting to board at 15h55 we were advised that there was a problem and that we should take a seat. After 20 minutes we were advised by a Cathay gate clerk that we had been removed from the flight because our SAA flight had been delayed and that we had been placed on another flight. We questioned what flight and were told to wait. The plane left the gate at 16h21. At 16h40 I requested to speak to the station manager. I was then told that an SAA representative would come and advise us of the situation. This did not happen and I found a Cathay Pacific gate handler who said that we had been removed from the flight in accordance with Cathay Pacific’s policy of a connecting flight “having to have arrived within 60 minutes of the next flights departure”. We then questioned what other flight arrangement had been made. His response was that it was an SAA problem and that it had to be sorted out with SAA. No further help was forthcoming and no-one from Cathay Pacific would help us. We then asked as to where we could recover our cases and we were told to “get them off the SAA carousel”. We scoured the airport for our bags and after an hour found them on a carousel with Cathay Pacific “Offloaded”. We then set out to find another route to Singapore – this was impossible as it was the height of the festive season rush. After visiting several airline counters we eventually found 2 business class tickets available with Singapore Airlines (at a cost of USD 3200). Once home we attempted to resolve our issues with Cathay Pacific but merely received a string of emails deflecting responsibility to SAA. It is important to note that we complied with Cathay Pacific’s conditions of carriage which were that we had to have checked in one hour before the flight and that we had to be at the gate 40 minutes prior to departure – when we arrived at the gate we were in possession of boarding passes with our seat allocations. SAA could not be held liable under these circumstances. We have spent the last 8 weeks trying to obtain a refund of our first class airfare and have also tried to obtain compensation for our replacement tickets. No joy – just a run around from Cathay Pacific. Cathay Pacific maintain that they “reserved the right to assign or reassign seats at any time, even after boarding”. They maintain that this gave them the right to cancel our seats and sell them to someone else.

"""appalling treatment on all fronts""","Flew Mumbai to Da Nang (or tried to) via Hong Kong with my wife and our 21 month old daughter. Flight from Mumbai to Hong Kong was fine, crew also. The trouble started when we got to Hong Kong about 20 minutes late and were met at the gate to be told we had already been shut out of the connecting flight to Da Nang. The connecting time was 1hr 10 minutes. I question why Cathay sell this route if they are going to operate on such a tight tolerance. We were taken to the desk where the ground staff first tried to fob us off with a flight 24hrs later and hotel. No good, not least because my wife would have needed a visa to leave the airport. Next, we were told to come back in 2hrs, and they took our boarding passes and gave us some vouchers for breakfast. I suppose better than nothing, though this is what it gets you. Though we were business class, no lounge available as we were the wrong side. When came back 2hrs later to the appointed place, things took on a nasty tone. First, the ground staff said they knew nothing about our situation and could not help because they needed the boarding passes. They even told me our connecting flight had already left - thanks for that! After trying in vain to get them to move, in the end, asked them to sign a statement with me that they did not know anything and so could not help - I said I'd leave them alone after that, sort things out myself and deal with Cathay later. They would not sign anything and said it was 'meaningless' to do so. Finally, another supervisor came over and we were eventually put on connecting flight via budget carrier and Vietnam Airlines via Hanoi. The only positive of this was that at least there was a Cathay staffer helping me with going in and out of immigration and check in /out of bags, laborious though it was. I repeatedly asked them to ensure the bags were checked through, which they said was done. After that, we were left to our own devices for a few hours, no lounge or anything even though we were business class and had a young child with us. The replacement flights were all economy too. Cathay still weren't done with us yet. When we got to Hanoi, thought it would be safer to check - lo and behold our bags weren't checked through. So once more, had to laboriously lug them between terminals, check in again. One finally arrived in Da Nang, 12h late, wrote a complaint and cancelled the return leg. Asked Cathay to refund 50% of the unused ticket and any difference for going via another carrier (there was none, as it turned out) since they could sell it on and it was 2 weeks away. I guess it was naïve to think Cathay would treat this reasonably, alas, after waiting 3 weeks for a reply, Cathay rejected it, hiding behind no refund policies and other than apologizing and offering USD150 / adult in travel vouchers, that was that. Any further pleas were met with a delayed response, apologies for the delay and hiding behind those policies.

One must choose one's seat wisely. Despite this, I believe that Cathay remains the best of premium airlines in the region. FA service was top notch and when the my experience is compared to North American or European carriers on flights of a similar length, Cathay is superior.

On the return, it was really like flying economy with the seat configuration being 2-4-2. Seat pitch was narrow and cramped. The only time we felt we were on premium economy was the Manila to Hong Kong leg of the trip because we had flown with a new plane and seats was noticeably wider.

"""I can still recommend Cathay""","After a gap of almost 15 years, I booked a return ticket from Paris CDG to Bangkok via Hong Kong, as I was curious to see what had changed. A first inconvenience occurred when, for the return journey, I was rebooked from BKK to HKG on an earlier flight, without any explanation, this causing a much longer connecting time in HKG while waiting my flight back to Paris. The day of my departure from Paris happened to be the maiden flight of A350 between CDG and HKG. The plane was full, and, for the reason of late cargo loading, we got 55 minutes delay. At this moment, while still on the ground I knew my connecting flight to BKK would be missed. When arriving in HKG, 12 hours later, a new boarding pass was swiftly given to me, with an attached voucher reaching the generous value of a hamburger at any airport Mc Donald’s. I had to wait 4 hours instead of 75 minutes in terminal. A bit disappointed on this situation, its handling of passenger being a little careless. Besides this not-so-good story, everything went smoothly. Cabins clean and cabin crew delivering a top quality service, efficient and professional. The attendants were well groomed, responsive and pleasant. CX catering, if compared to Emirates, is a little below in term of product, but the food is tastier, aiming at natural non-sophisticated dishes, rather than fancy bland food, and wine is served in generous portions. The IFE is satisfactory, with a decent variety of movies and TV shows. Comfort inflight is correct for economy class. Seat configuration 3-3-3 on 777’s and A350, and seat pitch is good. I regret that footrests have disappeared. Similarly, no longer hot towels and amenity kits in economy class. I would not applaud the ergonomy of meal trays, slipping on tablets, with not well stackable cups, and equipped with plastic cutlery instead of stainless (by the way, spreading butter with such curved knives is a real challenge for a left-handed like me). By and large, I can still recommend Cathay Pacific on the Asia-Europe route.

Mixed feelings on the more modern inbound segment with the new A350 in the newer small suite configuration. Meal service much better and full complement of IFE.

"""friendly and approachable""","Hong Kong to Paris. Check-in was very quick at a dedicated area in Hong Kong Airport. There were two porters that took the bags and a very nice and smiley agent completing the check in process within 1 minute. As I arrived slightly late at the airport, she walked me to the entrance of security and asked a more junior colleague to take me through security. The staff that accompanied me was not that necessary as we did not have to jump any queue. Hong Kong Airport must have the world's most efficient security screening and although there were quite a lot of people, the security and immigration process took less than 10 minutes. Did not have time to visit the lounge and once on board, the cabin crew asked me where my seat was and she immediately addressed me by my name. A very comfortable pyjamas, slippers, elaborate AESOP amenities kit were given out. Amuse bouche and champagne was served before take off. A restaurant style menu board was given as the senior crew member introduced himself followed by the junior crew refilling the champagne. Once off, they came round to take order for the late night supper which consisted of caviar, salmon, an extensive choice of Western and Chinese food. I was not hungry and ordered only a Chinese soup which was hot and very flavourful. I must have looked very tired and the crew suggested me to go get changed and they would set up the bed for me. When I returned, my seat turned into a very comfortable and wide bed. The crew proposed a cup of camomile tea which I gladly accepted. I slept for a good 10 hours and when I woke up, other passengers were already having their breakfast. I was hungry and opted to have the full breakfast of fruit, toasts, cereal and dim sum - quality comparable to many restaurants in Hong Kong. I asked the crew if I could have more toasts as I was still hungry, they proposed some scramble eggs or a bowl of wonton noodles for me. At the end, I had a hard boiled egg in a bowl of delicious wonton noodles. The cabin crew on this flight were classy but friendly and approachable at the same time, they give out the feeling that they were genuinely happy to have you travelling with them.

Cabin crew was enthusiastic as per Cathay's standards and exceeded my expectations for a 2-hour flight. Since I haven't experienced a ""regular"" Economy seat in a while now (I normally book bulkhead seats), I was shocked (in a good way) as to how much leg room there actually is. It's amazing how an extra inch of pitch can make a difference in flight. Hong Kong to Vancouver on a 1-year old 777-300ER, and honestly, it was my best experience of all the trips I've made on this sector. I reckon the majority of the crew are Vancouver-based, which I have noticed from the diversity of nationalities, as well as more attentive service as a whole. I'm not saying those of Hong Kong-based are inferior, but I definitely find the latter tend to rush the service a little. With that being said, this flight was excellent. FAs were responding to requests promptly, also going out of their way to give more than expected. Pushback and taxiing at Hong Kong were early, as the captain was trying to make up time for the surprisingly long flight time (11 hr 40 min, compared to the usual 10 hr 30 min). Despite the early departure, the flight was 30 minutes late into Vancouver, none of which are Cathay's fault as all flights from Asia were delayed coming in that day.

The seats have the same quality standard on the 777 (from Milan to Hong Kong) and the latest A350 (from Hong Kong to Auckland). For me the only difference between the two aircrafts were the slightly bigger windows in the A350 and the onboard camera on the top tail on the A350 . The Movie selection is one of the best.

The new business class seats are great, providing great privacy and space. However, the inflight service could be improved. Dinner service started late and took a long time. Also, being in the last row of business (there are two rows in a separate cabin just in front of premium economy) meant that the food was almost cold by the time it got to us. Service attention was patchy - tea for breakfast was served long after the tray was put down. Maybe it was that we were in the ""forgotten"" area, but it really was not a service experience that I would expect from all the things I had heard about Cathay. Also, the fact that premium economy passengers get to use the business class lavatories means a great deal of disturbance being seated on the alley. And lastly, having almost 5 minutes of advertising before the inflight entertainment starts, is a bit much, in my view. Watching TV series meant having to fast-forward every time. And, lastly, the question whether business class passengers should pay for Wifi access or not - or should at least have one hour for free.

Barely any smiles or greetings for frequent flyers and seemed ignorant to all requests and questions. My flight was delayed by 45 minutes and I asked if I could be moved my connecting flight to Bangkok in order to ensure both me and my bags make it. I got a response of ""No, the flight still shows on-time arrival. You will have plenty of time, plus, since you have a tight connection, your bags will be off-loaded first."" From previous experiences, any delays when flying against the jet stream through the Pacific Ocean mean extra delays, which is exactly what happened on this flight. Flight time to Hong Kong from Vancouver was 14 hours, approximately an hour longer than usual. Landed Hong Kong 45 minutes late, and I had to run for my life across the busy terminal to make my connection to Bangkok. I asked the ground staff at the gate in Hong Kong to check if my luggage has made it and by the time the flight was closing, they still ""weren't able to locate my bags"". I was discouraged and accepted the fact that my bags were going to miss the flight yet again. Landed in Bangkok on time, one of my bags showed up which was a blessing but the other took a later flight and got delivered to my house. Economy seats on the Boeing 777-300ER are great, one of the best in the industry in fact. While I was rushing to board my flight to Bangkok, which was operated on the Airbus A350-900 (exciting!), my boarding pass got an error message and hence I got upgraded to Premium Economy Class for the flight. The A350 cabin is by far one of the best in the skies nowadays and Cathay Pacific has properly defined the meaning of ""Premium Economy"" perfectly: the extra legroom, the seat amenities, the IFE, just to name a few. Food was amazing for Economy, edible and appropriate portions. Advice: Don't get the pasta unless you really have to. Go with the Western or Asian menu. Cabin crew service continues to be top notch on both flights, especially on the short-haul from Hong Kong to Bangkok.

"""not overly impressed with CX""","London to Brisbane via Hong Kong. Not overly impressed with Cathay Pacific. In particular, the new economy seating is great and comfortable in the upright position but for me is very uncomfortable when you try to recline it. I landed up with my seat upright, whilst the person in fron on both legs put their seat fully back. The trouble with that is that then I could no longer see the screen for entertainment, and my leg room virtually disappeared. The first leg overnight was also very hot, everyone was complaining about it. The food was reasonable but as a decent sized westerner, I landed up getting hungry by the time the next meal was served. Not too sure what the point is of supplying a tray with empty plastic boxes on it, like someone had removed some food for cost cutting. Overall, it wasn't very nice and not looking forward to the return leg.

"""lucky enough to be upgraded to premium""","Paris to Taipei via Hong Kong. Online check in was perfect, got to cut the queue just to drop my luggages and went in fast. Flight departed 15 minutes late to arrive 30 minutes early. Was surprised to find by myself that my connection flight in Hong Kong changed and was not the one announced aboard, had a free walk around HK airport for that, I was fortunate that I had two hours to walk to my next flight as I wanted to stretch my legs. Booked low fat meal: got steamed cod and veggies with rice with both appetizers and desserts as meal, baked apples with raisins as breakfast with toasted bread. Was tastier than it sounds. While my meals were provided with water, I could still ask for the other drinks every passenger is allowed to ask for, and got one strawberry ice cream. As snacks, there were peanuts, crisps/chips, apples and instant noodles. On the short HK-Taipei flight, I was given a chickpea pie, and a chickpea sandwich on my way back. Got lucky enough to be upgraded to premium thanks to the Chinese new year rush, so I could compare the premium and the regular economy classes. Only difference is leg room, a few discount vouchers to expensive stores and armrests, along with earplugs and blindfolds. I was still fine with regular leg room though, only missed the airplugs and blindfold on my way back. While the seat does get hard after a few hours, I still felt a bit more comfort than Eva Air despite the stopover. Also, the movie selection was nice. No problem with air crew.

When we were checking-in they gave us only one boarding pass to Hong Kong, telling that the flight from Hong Kong got cancelled and they have sent a mail (I never received)?. I requested the lady at check-in to help my parents find another flight as they cannot stay in airport for 26 hours. She assured me that my parents will be taken care, with no options left I had to depart them. Now the nightmare just began, on arrival the wheel chair staff took my parents are asked them to wait for 30 minutes - they waited and no one arrived. The airline information counter indicated that the connecting flight was cancelled because of few bookings and asked my parents to check with lounges for availability. They had no clue what do and where to go. They sat/slept on airport chairs for 26 hours.

The IFE is great with many choices. The service and food are another matter. MAN-HKG, food poor and service indifferent with one exception. Great on the flight and then spotted us looking confused searching for the arrivals lounge in HG airport, so took us there, above and beyond. HKG-MEL a few days later. New Pier lounge is fantastic. Large, many seating options, many food options, very good cocktail bar. Departure 00.05 so ate in the lounge, followed by cheese and wine on the plane. This was served promptly so sleep could be maximized. Good five hours sleep. Lights on 2 hours before landing to serve breakfast, and this is service complaint again. Served orange juice and coffee, then nothing for 30 minutes, then fruit and muesli then nothing for 30 minutes then omelette. The gap is too large. First coffee all drunk before any food and no top up offered. I asked 4 times for more coffee over an hour, so gave up and went for my own from the galley. This may sound picky, but this is a premium cabin, should not have to ask, and if I do, then it should be brought promptly. The food is just not good enough, especially the steak/Chilli Chicken (MAN-HG). Food is consistent, not good, over 7 flights now. We had better food on Thomson Airways Premium Economy in February, which is saying something.

While seat comfort and IFE remain excellent, cabin service and food quality have declined noticeably. Meals used to be a notch below Business Class; now they are basically standard Economy Class (I compared as I walked through the Economy section). Cabin crew serve Premium Economy food, and then continue into Economy, and eventually return to collect trays. They are rarely seen between meal times. Service and food standards are now virtually the same as Economy, but the fare is marked up 200-300% - a big difference for about 40% more space. You also have to walk back through Economy and compete for lavatories. Cathay Pacific Premium Economy is not good value any more, and unlikely to remain on my shopping list.

It is strange that, despite the fact that this is a 777, a newer type of aircraft, the seat was of the old type.

The A350 was much quieter than the other planes I have flown on, therefore I found it much easier to fall asleep. The cabin crew were much more attentive on this flight than the other long-haul Cathay flights I have flown, they distributed snacks and drinks throughout the flight, which hasn't happened to me on the other long-haul Cathay flights I have flown. The seat was better than the one on the 777 and the 330, it offered a lot more privacy. The seat was raised above than the actual footrest when it is on take-off/landing mode which is kind of annoying unlike the old one which was on the same level. Overall, It is really enjoyable to fly with Cathay especially when you are on an A350 as it is much quieter and the air is much better.

Lots of fruit, and light fish dishes, perfect when on a long haul journey. Plenty of room and the seat was comfortable. Excellent choice of inflight entertainment and cabin crew very attentive.

"""Wings lounge very appealing""","Recently, I travelled from Kolkata to New York JFK twice - once through Doha on Qatar Airways and the second time through HKG on Cathay Pacific. Gave me an opportunity to compare the business class product on two well regarded One World airlines. Qatar Airways uses Boeing 787 on CCU-DOH route - a much superior aircraft compared to the A320 that is operated by Cathay Drgaon on the CCU-HKG run on behalf of Cathay Pacific. The aircraft on the longer haul - DOH-JFK and HKG-JFK for both airlines is the Boeing 777-300. However, the seating layout on Cathay Pacific is 1-2-1 and in the herring bone format offering unmatched privacy. In contrast, the 777-300 on Qatar was 2-2-2 format with no privacy whatsoever. With the option of meals on request, throughout the duration of the flight, cabin attendants were scurrying up and down the aisles serving food and removing plates and table cloths, lights coming up, glare from the entertainment screen.  Flight attendants on both airlines are attentive, speak good English.  The entertainment systems were quite comprehensive on both segments of Qatar Airways but only so on Cathay's HKG-JFK segment. An ipad was provided on CCU-HKG sector. Amenities bags were provided on all segments. Quality and portions of food are comparable and both airlines offer a complement of international drinks. Schedule - Qatar leaves CCU at the unearthly hour of 3:30 at night; Cathay's departure is slightly more sensible at just past 1 an night. The transit time at both hubs - DOH and HKG are similar - and the overall journey is slightly faster on Qatar Airways by an hour or so. The flights were all on schedule. Transiting  Hong Kong is a more relaxing and well-organized airport to transit though a bus carried us between two terminals. The security check had no crowds. Doha presented a picture of huge crowds, the security check area looked frantic. The flight announcement board was crammed with information that it was impossible to locate your connecting flight gate.  I found the Wings lounge very appealing  from the range of food and drinks to the reliability of the wi-fi service to the cleanliness of the shower facilities. I used the lounge at Doha to escape the crowd, did not try the food or the showers, but it was comfortable though the wi-fi service was spotty. The fare is comparable and you can earn miles on both airlines by being a OneWorld member. So, overall, while both airlines offered a good quality product, I give a slight edge to Cathay Pacific -- for departure time, transfer at Hong Kong, and the privacy offered by the cabin layout. It does take a little bit longer to fly through Hong Kong than through Doha and while Qatar's 787 is a splendid plane, you cannot really enjoy it - you board the aircraft and go to sleep as soon as the plane takes off, but you do get to sleep on the flat bed seat, an option not available on Cathay Dragon's standard business seat in its A320.",0,8,R Sanyal,2016-10-22,yes,Business Class,Solo Leisure,CCU to JFK via HKG,October 2016,4,4,4,4,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

Configuration of 4 seats in middle is poor, economy 3 seats.

"""service was professional though not outstanding""","We chose Cathay as we wanted premium economy for the leg room and the Qantas flight to Shanghai does not offer premium economy for some reason. The Qantas option would have been our preference as it did not require a stop in Hong Kong. Flight was on time and service was professional though not outstanding. Seats were adequate as was legroom though the footrest was not as comfortable or well designed as the Qantas seat. Food was again adequate but not outstanding. Unlike Qantas and Virgin, we were not acknowledged by name (a minor point admittedly) and were not offered a cup of tea/coffee at the end of the meal on the return flight. We can only compare premium economy to Qantas and Virgin Australia and Cathay comes off in third place due to seats and service. In our opinion Qantas premium economy is way out in front due to seat design, food quality and service. On a recent trip from Johannesburg to Sydney we experienced the most outstanding service we have ever had and one of the most comfortable flights out side of business class. Cathay did not come up to this standard and it was probably a waste of money for premium for a 9 hour flight. The return flight fromHong Kong to Sydney was no different.

Cathay Pacific seats are much better, fishbone 4 across against British Airways 8 seats across which results in narrow seats. But departure at T3 is less good.

A brand new A350 with a gorgeous modern cabin, a good start so far, I settle into my new business class seat and noticed a much larger TV, superior remote control and the seat seem to have a little more padding and a little bit wider. I found I can watch a movie before take off unlike the B777, I also found a more detailed flight map, flight details and two outside cameras. I settle into my sleep blanket which actually work just like a sleeping bag, a clever idea.

The business class offering from Cathay Pacific is superb. At HK airport I got access to several lounges spread through the airport. My favourite being The Wing. The flight itself was excellent. Extremely courteous and efficient FAs. I think that the business class seats in Cathay are as good as some first class seats on some airlines. The seat fully reclined to a flat bed with ample space to stretch. Im 5'7"" by the way. The 1-2-1 configuration means all seats get aisle access and you don't feel claustrophobic, which you do on some of the other airlines that have a 2-2-2 configuration. All in all a great flight.

We advised the cabin crew on arrival in Sydney (I had vomited in bathroom as plane taxied on runway) and although concerned to hear it they did not make any report or follow up. On getting home from the airport my husband then spent 2 days in bed, and I spent 24 hours. We felt unwell for several days. We contacted customer services and provided completed forms, as requested. We received acknowledgement of the forms (2 weeks after the flight) and were advised that the forms would be sent to the catering team and we would hear back. 5 weeks on from the flight and we are still waiting for feedback. We had expected that with a potential food issue there would be prompt action. Unfortunately this has not been the case.

From Hong Kong to Toronto, we were provided with small amenity bags from GOD (a local Hong Kong brand) containing earplugs, socks, and a sleeping mask. The extra leg room, roomier armrests, and noise-canceling headphones were much appreciated during the almost 15-hour long flight (18 hours including the transfer from Shanghai). Although the meal itself was the same as the one in economy, our trays had metal cutlery and a small tablecloth, which was a nice touch. We were also provided with some bubbly prior to take off.

Assistance was arranged to get us quickly through the airport and we made the domestic flight with minutes to spare (a near record - 45 mins from touch down to take off, including a 10 minute walk between terminals. CX's food is generally good and it was a nice touch to be offered chopsticks to go with Asian food. Water bottles were replenished throughout the flights too.

The flight was good, though the Airbus A340 is long in the tooth and the herring bone style seats make one feel very hemmed in and also have very little storage space. Entertainment options are by no means as comprehensive as Emirates and there is no ability to send messages between seats. Hong Kong was a positive joy with swift transfers and a delightful stop at the Pier Lounge, which has to rank as one of the best anywhere. Different themed eating areas, a stylish bar, great showers and heaps of space. Business Class on the Boeing 777 was a marked improvement in terms of space and storage and had a good night's sleep.

Short-haul to Bangkok on a full 3-class Boeing 777-300ER (a surprise of aircraft on a regional route), service was definitely a little more rushed due to the short flight time, but the professionalism was still there.

It's a rare occasion when I have seen their ground staff smile or try and make an effort to connect with the passengers, and the in-flight staff has similarly stopped any pretense at courtesy it feels like. And if you are traveling with small children, it is almost inevitable that they would be subject to extra rigourous seat belt safety protocols.

Also, is it even hygienic having all the exposed food with the crew member standing directly over it talking to passengers as she progresses down the aisle. Give me the 1 on 1 delivery anytime as with most carriers, much more personalised. You are offered bread once, then have to request any more later (bread basket should be brought through several times during meal as with most other airlines). What other airline does not provide salt and pepper on the meal tray? I had to ask as I thought it was just a missed item on my tray but was told you have to ask for it. My rack of lamb consisted of 2 of the smallest lamb cutlets possible (overcooked and dry) with a spoonful of risotto and 1 cherry tomato.  The sea bass was also terribly overcooked and barely warm.

"""best meal I've ever had on CX""","Semi-frequent flyer of Cathay Pacific, so not surprised service was as on par as usual. Red-eye flight between Hong Kong and New York Kennedy with a stopover in Vancouver. Transit passengers from HKG boarded prior to passengers departing from YVR through a gate with partition in between. Boarding for YVR-originating passengers was a bit hectic, and gate agents were running around trying to get priority boarding completed before general boarding began. I was granted priority boarding, thanks to the benefits of their frequent flyer program. I was greeted with enthusiasm and warmth by the purser, a great way to start a trip. Business Class was very empty, Premium Economy was almost full, and Economy was 80% full (a lot of the middle seats were empty). Personally, I felt like the crew were able to provide a more comfortable service, as there was no hassle to get through the meal service. Choice of food were either rice with chicken in a black bean sauce, or braised beef with mashed potatoes.

"""family had to sit separately""","Long haul flight of 13 hours from San Francisco to Hong Kong. Good aircraft and good service. However the meal timings were quite odd. The flight left SFO at 1:30 am. and after an hour, around 2:30 am, they began to serve drinks and then dinner, it is not practical. After drinks they should have just served some light snacks. Who wants to have dinner at 2:30 am? Its obvious people were not hungry and eager to sleep, so most of the passengers wasted the good food. then after that there was no food service; only juice was served every hour or so quietly so as not to disturb the sleep. Around 6 or 7 in the morning (SF time), people were getting hungry and all that they had available was apples and chips and cookies. Thats the time when everyone needed a good breakfast! Then just one hour before landing they served breakfast, which was around 4 am Hong Kong time (destination). there was hardly any time before landing, so people had to eat hurriedly. This is quite absurd. They need to serve meals at appropriate timings. Someone needs to tell them that. The toilets were being cleaned regularly, but with a full capacity flight the trash bins were almost always full and overflowing! The flight was full but the checkin staff did not make any effort to allot seats together for families, many seats were pre-booked and many family members had to sit separately throughout the 13 hour flight.

They offered me a drink just before take off. They handed me one bottle of water shortly before serving me food. I did not want a full blown meal at 2 am and asked for the light option which was advertised as soup. But instead they gave me a disgusting salad with some fruit in a dish. Ate the fruit and left everything else. After sleeping for the best part of the journey the next offering after only three visits was offer of juice and tea. Followed closely by breakfast offering. Thankfully recognise able in the form of scrambled egg with hash brown and a streak of bacon. Shortly followed by another offering of juice. I asked for tea which never appeared. That was that. Am I expecting too much? Family flew economy on the way out with me and from what they told me they had more attention and food / drink offerings than me. Something not quite right here.

After take off, food was served starting with caviar, followed with salat and fish. Food was fantastic together with Krug champagne and superb wines. The little welcome card on dish tray written by crews is surprisingly warm. The bed in Cathay is one of the most comfortable. The seat was converted into a wide bed when I changed in to the PJs.

The other passengers make it a let-down flight but cannot fault Cathay Pacific on service. Flight took off late due to late passengers - missing our push back time, and also our number in the queue, but they still landed ahead of schedule. Other airlines are not as forgiving with what time you should be at the gate, and they definitely need to impose stricter rules. Food was great (same as Economy). Seat pitch and leg space generous. Staff were great, however one was slightly lacking manners compared to the others. HK - London. Another full flight and the staff coped very well considering. A shame that airlines do not have other restrictions on hand luggage as when nearly every passenger brings on a hard shell suitcase, you are forced to have your bag under your seat for being the more considerate flier with a smaller bag. IFE was great. I have flown with CX quite a lot recently so I had already caught up with all the latest films but great selection overall. Food was great (Hagen Daaz is definitely a plus!), snacks available and they were prompt with all my requests. Seat pitch not bad. Leg space is OK, but if you have a lot in the front pocket, it is reduced somewhat. Landed ahead of schedule.

Continuous cool draft from three sides for whole flight meant this I was too cold to sleep even with 2 blankets and a newspaper under my shirt. Most people in PE appeared cold. My advice is to take a fleece in your carry-on. CP had several staff at Perth at the departure gate who have English as their first language.

Even more disappointing was there were no juice/beverage runs for the entire flight although it was nearly a five hour flight.

"""does not represent value for money""","My wife and I recently traveled Melbourne-Hong Kong return with Cathay Pacific. Having previously taken this trip a number of times as economy class passengers we decided to pay the extra and try premium economy (PE), not a good decision. Our problems started when checking in at Melbourne airport. Although booked as Mr and Mrs, we were advised that we were not sitting together. After some discussion crew resolved this at the gate lounge. However, on the return flight we were told once again that we would not be seated together, actually behind each other in the center of the middle three seats. Notwithstanding our objections we were dismissed by ground staff and advised that there was nothing they could do about our situation. On previous flights with other airlines, domestic and international, we have always managed to be seated together when booked as a couple. The dinner meal choices were very limited. There was actually only one choice, as the other listed meal had apparently run out prior to the food cart arriving in the PE section. In addition to this the tray tables in my row could not be deployed without considerable effort and the assistance of other passengers and crew. When combined with the issue of sharing economy toilets at the rear of the aircraft it occurs to me that there is really nothing to suggest that Cathay Premium Economy class is anything more than a more expensive ‘economy’ ticket with a somewhat larger seat. Lots of ‘economy’ and not a lot of ‘premium’. While performance on the day depends entirely on the crew encountered, in my opinion the overall performance of the airline has deteriorated since we first traveled with them five years ago.

My experience puts Cathay firmly in the excellent category. Half way into the flight (6 hours in) one of the passengers required urgent medical assistance. The pilot made the decision of turning the plane around and making an unscheldued stop in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The crew dealt with the situation extremely professionally. The stopover meant an extra 4 hours added to the journey, which meant I missed my connecting flight. On landing in Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific staff were waiting to assist passengers with connecting flights. Amazingly they had already sorted out onward flights, new boarding passes and for those who had onward flights rearranged for the next day like me, they had already organised overnight accommodation and transfers. I didnt have to ask for anything! Every detail was explained and sorted out for me before I'd even stepped off the plane.

Cabin crew was courteous and attentive, but they didn't really seem to make much eye contact. Don't remember too many in flight announcements. Cabin overall quiet and comfortable. Plenty of good movies and games. Lots of newspapers. The only negatives I could observe were the bathrooms and the very very cold air coming out of the emergency slide door.

They are quite flat but as hard as a rock and the seat belt is designed for very small people. There are no mattresses offered and the blanket is some kind of doona.

"""very pleasant experience""","LHR-HKG and HKG-PER after a longer layover in HKG in January, LHR-HKG (night flight) on a Boeing 777-300ER, HKG-PER (day flight) on an A330-300ER, both in Business Class – flights on time or early and a very pleasant experience. FA’s friendly and attentive, present in the cabin without being obtrusive. I found the lie-flat seats to be very comfortable and the herringbone 1-2-1 arrangement on both planes great. While the seat on the A330 clearly showed some wear and tear, everything was in working order. Food out of LHR was ok without being great. Dinner was a rather bland lobster appetizer and salad, followed by a braised pork cheek with root vegetables (or Chinese stir fried beef or herb chicken breast or pumpkin pasta in cheese sauce), plus cheese, fruit and cake for dessert. Breakfast was a breakfast frittata (or apple pancake or chicken and mushroom congee). Full warn breakfast, but again not that convincing. Food out of HKG was much better. The halibut curry was of restaurant quality. Other choices were pork spare ribs or Australian beef tenderloin or pasta in a tomato basil sauce. Starter was Cajun prawn (good as well) and again various dessert choices. Second meal before landing was seafood pie (tasty) or beef noodle soup. The wines that I tried were good without being great. IFE (CX studio) was AVOD; responsive and with ok screens. Selection was varied, however a little light on new Western releases. Commercials before every selection were slightly irritating, but you could fast forward, so not a big deal. Constant commercials during the flight map were just irritating. Restrooms were kept clean throughout both flights – CX Lounge in LHR was closed for renovation. I used BA’s Galleries Lounge which in T3 is a comfortable and relaxing place with ok food and drinks - much better than the alternative option of the AA Admirals Club. Check in in HKG was fast and hassle-free with no lines. I used CX The Wing lounge, which is excellent with various service areas including a manned bar and a made to order noodle station.

"""economy class disappointing""","Cathay Pacific economy class was disappointing. I had heard great things about Cathay Pacific before, so I was excited to try them out on a flight from Jakarta, Indonesia to Newark, USA, with a layover in Hong Kong. Overall, Cathay got me where I needed to go, but not comfortably. I don't think I'll be taking them again any time soon. I had a slight delay in both Jakarta and Hong Kong, but this was likely due to many people traveling that day and air control traffic.  I reached my destination around our expected arrival time and the flight was smooth. Ground service in Jakarta was perfectly nice, but the cabin service both from Jakarta to Hong Kong and Hong Kong to Newark left much to be desired. The service on the Jakarta leg was much better, but it still took a while to get anything to drink. The staff were kind of smirky and not particularly nice, but not outright rude. However, the staff on the Hong Kong to Newark leg were much worse. I had an arm injury and had difficulty getting someone to help me store my bag overhead, eventually a kind fellow passenger helped, but the fact that there was a staff member right there who ignored my request for help irked me a bit. Then came the food service. It took so long to get anything to drink or eat. At one point I had to wait three hours for a cup of water, even after pressing the service request button several times. I think this is unacceptable. Two meals were served on this trip. The dinner option was okay, but the breakfast was awful, I couldn't even finish it. The chairs were pretty uncomfortable in economy. Usually I don't have much trouble falling asleep on airplanes, but my seats on Cathay were really uncomfortable for some reason. I'm a very short person, so leg room doesn't bother me much, but if you're taller, you will probably feel squeezed. On the other hand, the entertainment system was excellent. Although not as up-to-date as the ones on ANA and Singapore Airlines, which have controllers for games, the modes on Cathay had a wide selection of movies and TV shows, which helped keep me occupied while I couldn't sleep. I think it was the only part of the flight that really lived up to its hype. Cathay Pacific has a great reputation for flights around Asia. I can vouch for them getting you where you need to go and having a great entertainment system, but not for much else. I'm sure their business class is wonderful, but if you're an economy class flier, I would recommend checking somewhere else.",0,5,Melissa Tustin-Gore,2016-02-15,no,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,CGK to EWR via HKG,January 2016,3,2,4,2,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

"""get you from A to B""","This was the return sector from Hong Kong to Manchester. While my expectations are somewhat managed in Economy, in that you always seem to be treated as the poor relation, Cathay, along with many other airlines, fail to give adequate room to Economy Passengers and again you have to wrestle with your fellow passengers to eat a simple meal. We had tried to upgrade a few times over the holiday, though the look on the faces of the staff were akin to ""Not over my dead body"" this wasn't going to happen. I even mentioned that I was not looking for a free, but a paid upgrade, though this was met with the same look. When we boarded the plane in Hong Kong, I noticed that there were spare extra leg room seats near the exit doors and this became a free for all and soon occupied by people who happily pointed out their allocated seat somewhere else. Even a family with small children seemed to meet the criteria of sitting in the exit seats. Cathay overall does what it says on the tin. They get you from A to B.

Boarding on Cathay long haul is usually reasonably quick once commenced. I chose a window seat toward the rear.

The seat can't be reclined, it was very uncomfortable. But, for the other service, it's perfect! The food was good and the in-flight entertainment was good.

It's slightly smaller from Hong Kong to Melbourne. The food was disappointing for such a long journey but better going out than on the return leg. The bar snacks were poor and the noodles finished early into the journey. Unfortunately there was an electrical fault during our journey which meant coffee was unavailable. Strangely at breakfast they managed to produce hot drinks. No newspapers or magazines offered on this flight but available in the airport lounge if travelling business class. Vanity bag not impressive. TV screen annoying as too many adverts when looking at the map. Aside from these niggles, the most important aspect was the comfort of the seat and this was excellent, even for my 6ft 5in son.

The inflight entertainment system didn't work well, spontaneous reboots on several screens during flight and the sound didn't work at all in one of the seats. The offered food service did not meet the expectations, and they ran out of chicken meals long before they reached our seat and the only choice left was the fish.

"""upgrade to Business Class""","Hong Kong to Vancouver. When you show up at the airport with one bag that is obviously too heavy, one should have a plan of action. My plan was that I was going to use my Asia Miles to pay for the extra weight. Luckily, I was served by the Check-in Counter Team Leader and he said I could either use 24,000 Miles for the excess weight (it was very heavy) or use 20,000 Miles to upgrade from Premium Economy to Business Class (and not have to pay for excess weight.) I didn't think seats were available, he said there was 1 left and it was mine. So, with only 5 minutes of waiting, I was given my Business class seat, my lounge invitation and I was on my way! Went to the Bridge Lounge (essentially two lounges in 1) then to Gate 2 for departure. The plane departed on-time and it was a very full flight. The champagne along with great meal services made the flight home fly by (pun intended). Even with the large amount of Business Class passengers, the Chief Purser made her way and introduced herself to each and everyone of us. I didn't think she would remember our names, but during the flight, whenever she saw me, she referred to me by name and asked how my flight was going. With the re-branding, CX also released a new animated Safety Briefing, along with new Safety Cards. My only complaint is the lack of the air conditioning controls for the seats, and the lack of air flow to the Business Class seats when you are sleeping. With your head in-between two walls, no air can come in or out.

Not the best, however a nice quiet spot to sit and relax before the 14 hour flight. Flight was delayed due to a late arrival of the inbound aircraft. Unfortunately, the gate agents (who were also the ticket agents) didn't update the YVR passengers on when we would be able to board. The cabin crew for this part of the flight were also waiting with us and they didn't have any ideas on when we would be able to depart. Eventually, approximately an hour later, we all boarded and took off for HKG. Service on board was amazing. The initial drink service into the dinner service was quick and efficient. However, the snacks weren't ""served"" in Premium Economy, as most of us were asleep in the cabin. I got up and walked around the cabin and got the snacks myself.

"""upgraded to business class""","Hong Kong to San Francisco with Cathay Pacific. Booked on premium economy but upgraded to business class at boarding, pleasant surprise and no complaint. Seat 19D. Priority boarding and welcome from friendly crew with pre-departure drink and hot towel served. Menu and amenity kit provided. Pillow and duvet on the foot rest. Nice cabin layout in 1x2x1. Cabin nearly full.  Flight deck announcement was clear and informative. Some turbulence during the flight and arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule.  Made the trip from Hong Kong to San Francisco in about 11 hours and 28 minutes. Once airborne, supper service with drinks. Cheese plate available on request. Service was concluded in about two hours so plenty of time to rest and sleep. Since I was upgraded, my main meal was from economy in disposable tray placed on a ceramic plate. The salad was awful with no dressing and fruit salad as dessert, both in plastic economy containers but transferred to a tray with cloth napkin and metal cutlery. Vegetarian option, either western or Asian, are always awful and disgusting on Cathay Pacific. Asian options are usually overcooked vegetable in oily sauce served with steamed rice. Western options are typically some sort of pasta swimming in tomato based sauce. Anyway did not eat much of the food other than the fruit salad. Cabin crew friendly and available through the flight. Since I was upgraded from premium economy I was mostly ignored and not served additional food items such as dessert tray or cheese plate. Slept for a few hours. Woke up hungry and had to ask for some fresh fruit but was told that they did not have fresh fruit onboard but she will check in the economy cabin. She came back with left over cheese plate and fruit bowl from left over supper service. Watched a few movies and it was time for pre-arrival breakfast. This is strange as we were arriving into San Francisco International Airport at 9PM why they were serving breakfast at that hour? Would prefer to have light snacks such as a sandwich or a bowl of soup.  The pre-arrival snack again was transferred to the meal tray from economy cabin. Some kind of corn and something else and salad minus dressing plus fresh cut fruit for desert. Noticed one thing in both premium economy and business class is that Cathay Pacific has eliminated salt and pepper in both cabins. In premium economy cabin you used to get salt and pepper sachets and stone shakers in business cabin but not for the last 3 trips. Immigration is a breeze at that hour and custom was quick. Bags took a while to come out, more than typical. Overall an OK flight in business. Comfortable seat in business cabin for skinny people, large people will find the seat to be very narrow especially at the foot well when the seat goes horizontal.

I noticed quite often my internal clients are upgraded, resulting in a lot of positive feedback. Quite a lot of timeslots available. So plenty of choice to arrive at your desired time. Good corporate rates, very competitive compared to its main rival for Singapore flights. Main lounge is good, and in some cases, the business class gate waiting area is separate from economy.

Nevertheless, I was put up in a nice airport hotel in Hong Kong and then had impeccable service from the wonderful cabin crew en-route to Zurich. Only one aspect spoilt this flight experience and that was the final meal - it was possibly the worst airline meal I have ever had. I found out that even with a major delay of 9 hours or more, the same food is kept for that particular flight making it some 21 hours before it is finally consumed - and it tasted like it too!

All had showers, and plenty of choice, though both the Wing and the Bridge got very busy around 23.30 as there are a number of departing flights at that time. The Boeing 777-300 in particular is very comfortable with lots of storage space. The A340 was the only aircraft where the seat was less comfortable (the so-called coffin seat). I'd ordered a veggie meal: this was delivered on all flights but instead of just the main meal being vegetarian, the whole tray was a dedicated veggie tray; what this means is that I had no choice at all of entree or dessert, though there were vegetarian alternatives available.

"""service practically non existent""","The food on Cathay Pacific Airways was truly atrocious - I had ordered a gluten free meal and they seem to think that offering a plate of salad leaves and a few pieces of green limp peppers is the best they can do. The normal menu was a piece of salmon which would have been completely fine - clearly they have no clue as to what contains gluten and err on the side of extreme caution. The breakfast served on arrival into Hong Kong was marginally better and actually looked more palatable then the congealed food offered on the normal menu, so much so that I decided not to cancel the gluten free meal for my return journey - big mistake! Breakfast on flight back into Manchester was what looked like a piece of steak with lump mash - disgusting! Most of the staff onboard on the way out were friendly however the purser was rude and the not the customer service you would expect whether you were travelling in economy or business class. The service on the way back was practically non existent as they clearly expect on a 0100hrs flight that no one will expect anything - only one drink offered prior to the meal service and nothing offered with the actual meal. On request of a bottle of water - it arrived 20 mins later. The seats are fine, however the inflight entertainment needs a serious upgrade in comparison to other airlines. As this is a relatively new direct service from Manchester, I expected more and would definitely not recommend this service to anyone. I dread to think what it was like in economy if business was so bad!",0,3,Alison Chambers,2015-10-15,no,Business Class,Solo Leisure,Manchester to Hong Kong,October 2015,5,1,5,2,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
"""disappointed on other flights""","Perth to Manila via Hong Kong return on Cathay Pacific. The first leg from Perth to Hong Kong met expectations, but disappointed on the other flights due to repeated equipment / power failure. The malfunctioning in-flight entertainment on all three legs made the experience rather challenging and frustrating. If it was not for exceptional service of ground and cabin crew, I would not consider flying Cathay Pacific again.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"I recently flew Cathay Pacific from Melbourne to Zurich via Hong Kong (return) in business class. The Cathay attendants and ground staff were excellent on both legs of my trip. The seats really are first rate and Cathay Pacific business is the equal of first on some airlines. The food and drink was also good. The only criticism would be that the lounge in Melbourne really is a bit small and the range of food and drink available are underwhelming. ZRH lounge is a bit better, but not great. If you are flying on to other destinations it's a bit of a drag to have to route your trip through ZRH and connections on the return trip may require a night spent at ZRH depending on the departure time. Cathay Pacific could turnover their IFE films a bit quicker, but no problem if your trip straddles two calendar months.",0,9,John Gaffney,2015-10-09,yes,Business Class,Couple Leisure,MEL to ZRH via HKG,September 2015,5,4,4,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

At 2:15am they informed that flight will depart at 4am, and then at 2:30am they informed that flight will depart at 6:00am. Still waiting for flight - God knows when it will depart. If they could tell us in the night itself that they will depart in morning, we can have stay in some hotel in night. But Cathay Pacific arrangements are very bad.

"""definitely will use Cathay again""","This was my first long distance flight with Cathay Pacific, from Zurich to Manila via Hong Kong, and I was pleasantly surprised. The seat, the seat space, the food and the cabin crew were above average. The most important thing for me was the handling of the flight delay. There was a one hour delay in Zurich and it was obvious there is no chance on a 11 hour flight to land in Hong Kong in time. I had a connecting flight to Manila. The time between flights was only 50 minutes, which is a bit crazy. To my surprise, the ground crew of Cathay was prepared to name about 35 passengers with that connecting flight to Manila, gathered us in the front of the airplane so we could get off the plane right after it stopped at the gate. On the ground they guided us quickly thru the airport to the connecting flight, which was waiting for us. We landed in Manila over one hour later as scheduled, but at least for me that was okay.

The service from the cabin staff was also good, the food was OK, and the ground service did allow us on before the economy passengers. But you do have to share the toilets with the economy passengers, which is a problem at busy times, and does put me off a little. I think Cathay Pacific needs to also consider Lufthansa's idea of getting paid entry to the business lounge.

"""staff welcoming and attentive""","New York to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific Airways. Arrived at JFK on AA for this flight with a boarding pass from an AA kiosk, but wanted a CX ticket, so I visited the counter in terminal 7 and the person that helped me was helpful, printing the pass and answering questions about the flight. Terminal 7 is a bit limited, gate area small, and gate staff appeared mostly non-CX. The boarding was efficient. Staff were welcoming and attentive on board. I had an exit row on the left side. There was a fair amount of activity in the galley throughout the flight, and the duty free appeared to be in front of us, so not a good choice if you sleep lightly. The food was a bit lower than other Asia carriers (ANA etc), but above US carriers. Entertainment system was good (exit rows have to store armrest screens early), but the selection of non-English content lacked English subtitling. Not an overly busy flight, which helped the experience. Depending on price gap above US carriers, it is worth spending a bit extra.",0,8,S Elkins,2015-09-23,yes,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,JFK to HKG,September 2015,5,3,4,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
"""got off the flight feeling fresh""","This was my first flight to Europe in Premium Economy. I have flown Premium Economy to Asia with Qantas and BA but 8 hours is a lot different to 24 hrs.  The width of the Cathay Pacific premium economy seat and armrest are big enough that you do not touch the person next to you and do not feel restricted when eating. I had a bulkhead to HKG and it is the best option but the leg rest is a little short - putting my cabin bag on the floor overcame that issue. To Paris I was one row back, so only had the foot rest but it was still okay. When the seat in front is on full recline there is still plenty of room. 8 inches of recline doesn't sound much but combined with the seat width it is surprisingly good enough to get some good sleep. There is separate boarding for PE and this works well and they make it very clear that you are not in Economy. A glass of champagne before take-off is always nice. I read reports that cabin staff can be absent during the flight. and to a degree that's right, but they are very friendly and efficient. If you request something via the call button they are quick to respond so I was happy. IFE is as good as anyone else. Its not Business Class, but that does not mean its uncomfortable or basic. The Premium Economy cabin is curtained off from economy so you do feel a little privileged but get brought down to earth each time you have to share the Economy toilets. I got off the flight feeling fresh, which to me, was a compliment to the product. I think the Qantas seat and environment on the A380 (not the 747) is slightly better but its only marginal. Cathay Pacific nudges ahead of BA by a similar small margin. You wouldn't be unhappy with PE on any of the carriers but what I think what makes Cathay Pacific Premium Economy of choice is that, apart from a quality product, they have priced it ""on the money"" and this puts them ahead of Qantas. If you've got an appropriate tier status with Oneworld you get to use Business or First Class Lounges en route and the CX ones are very good (particularly The Wing in HKG) which adds to the overall comfort of the flight.",0,8,Paul Sprich,2015-09-22,yes,Premium Economy,Solo Leisure,Melbourne to Paris via HKG,September 2015,4,3,5,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

From the moment you enter the aircraft you are looked after excellently. I am a Oneworld Emerald and it is a nice touch when the purser or CSD gives you an extra welcome and chat prior to departure, thanking me for flying with Cathay. They look after the regular travellers and go out of their way to make sure you are well looked after, served food and drinks first, giving you more time to rest. The seat is very comfortable and spacious with lots of storage space and space next to the window. Seat reclines to the full flat position. What I like about the seat is that the screen folds away and also the tray table. I am very tall and  can stretch out fully in these seats.

"""I will not use Cathay again""","We bought our Cathay Pacific Airways tickets 8 months ago to travel in November from Toronto to Hong Kong on a direct flight. I used Expedia to get my full fare ticket whereas my husband used his Asia miles to redeem his. Then last week I got a call from Expedia telling me that our Nov 11 afternoon flight got cancelled by Cathay. We were bumped to the next flight out on Nov 12. Since my husband used mileage redemption, there is no flexibility to move to earlier departure dates. I used 4 hours to call Marco Polo Club (airlines membership), Asia Miles and Expedia to sort things out. How could a major airline cancel a flight 2 months before departure? Big impact on passengers who make same day connections to other Asian cities via Hong Kong. In our case, I prepaid a non-refundable hotel room.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Just prior to boarding time, announcement that the aircraft was experiencing technical issues and would be delayed. The delay ended up being 5 hours as the original issue couldn't be fixed and a new plane was required. The CX gate staff took a fair amount of grief from a few vociferous individuals during this time and whilst they could be criticised for not providing information in a timely manner and on occasion promising an update within 10 mins and not delivering that for 30 mins or so, CX should be complimented for how quickly they ended up getting us away. First off, no one should question an airline that delays departure because of a technical issue. Assuming it took an hour or so to determine that the fault could not be fixed, and a replacement aircraft required, it then took CX less than 4 hours to find that aircraft, ensure it was in operational condition, fuel it up, unload the previous aircraft, load up the new aircraft and no doubt complete copious amounts of paperwork. On top of this, a replacement pilot was required due to the restrictions on working hours. During the delay CX offered vouchers to cover an adequate snack and also provided complimentary bottles of water at the gate.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"A very long flight, and so I chose a window seat so that I could look at the Himalayas, Hindu Kush ect. But not allowed to because the blinds were to be pulled down for all the legs of the journey, both in and out of Hong Kong. Apparently this is Cathay Pacific policy, and is to encourage passengers to sleep (thereby keeping them quiet). I can sleep well on a plane, but not for 24 hours!

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Outbound flight from LHR to HKG was late taking off by half an hour, so my bags didn't make the connecting flight to Guangzhou as the connection was only an hour in the first place. I found the seat and leg room quite small compared to Emirates economy, also the service was not up to the same standard. My bags were delivered by courier a day later. The same trouble on the return leg as the one Guangzhou flight to hong kong was delayed, and I had to tear through to board for the hong kong-london leg. My bags just made it. Noisy, rattling aircraft and again seat felt cramped.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Apart from a delayed take-off the flight Paris-Hong Kong (B777) was un-eventful. Seats were a bit hard but good legroom. Good entertainment system. Pre-dinner drink service well received. Meals rather bland and tasteless. No cabin service to speak of. Hong Kong-Adelaide flight (A330) late take off due to disorganised boarding procedure and extra security checks inside the airbridge, which seem pretty brief, pointless and frustrating to me. Seat comfort better than B777 but seemed like less legroom. Entertainment system had no sound, FA went to check but never returned. Another FA was blunt to the point of rudeness when I tried to use toilet 40 minutes after take off because seat belt sign was still on - yet 6 other passengers had already done so and several others were on their feet. No pre-dinner drinks service. During meal service FA spilled a glass of wine into my lap. Noisy sleepless flight. Not happy. My rating below is based on this flight. In respect of all four of our Cathay Pacific flights to Paris return I was disappointed with the on-line check in and seat selection process. Not once did we get the seats we pre-booked nor did the on-line check in work properly. I chose Cathay Pacific because of their previous top rating.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"I'm sure this is in the terms and conditions, but it had never happened to me before. Upon check-in at Singapore I was asked to present my credit card. I said I didn't have it with me as I didn't realise I needed to present it. So the lady at check-in said I couldn't board my flight today. I said I've paid online, have a ticket, asked why I can't fly, told them I'm not going anywhere until I get on that flight or am at least not told why, so I was asked to hand over all my details and step to the side while the rest of the flight was checked in. About 45 minutes later the check-in lady asked for my credit card company contact phone number, I said I did not know and she could easily find it on an internet search, which I would've done if I was able. 15 to 20 minutes later I was told I was allowed to check in, after almost everyone in line had left. Eventually check-in told me I needed to present the physical credit card I booked with to prevent credit card fraud, even though on the e-ticket the credit card name matched my name on the booking and on my passport, so I don't see how this would constitute fraud if all my details matched. At no time was there ever any sympathy or apology.

First Class lounge at Heathrow Airport is a sheer delight, peaceful, very few passengers and excellent breakfast. It was such a lovely experience - champagne, food and full attention to me.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Cathay Premium Economy is about extra space and absolutely nothing else. If all you are seeking is additional space then fine but this is not true Premium Economy. The meal choices and portions are economy class as is the service or lack thereof. There was not even a menu offered that subsidiary Dragonair can offer in economy. One quick run to dump an economy class meal and drink and that was it for Premium. Not even close to premium service compared to other carriers.,0,5,A McNicol,2015-08-04,no,Premium Economy,Business,Beijing to Hong Kong,August 2015,5,1,4,1,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The plane was very clean, had good entertainment options and the food was lovely. However I felt the layout of Premium Economy wasn't the best as there is only one toilet in Premium which is located on the right hand side of the cabin. This meant every passenger on the left side who needed to use the rest room (which could be several times on a 14 hour flight) would have to cross the bulkhead seats (which is where I was sat) at the front of the cabin. If you plan to sleep do not select these seats as you will be knocked by passengers trying to cut across to use the rest room. I also felt CP have tried to fit too many seats in the bulkhead row of the middle section. I feel the end two seats impede the aisle from business class so when catering came through the curtain from business to premium there is a good chance your left leg might take a bump. Three seats in this row would probably be a better option. The seats could have been a little comfier for the money paid. The only downfall on the entertainment was that it was a little light on choice, I've traveled other airlines in premium economy and they had a healthier selection of films. Overall I would travel with Cathay Pacific again but will probably spend the extra money to fly in business class.",0,8,Nicholas Whitehouse,2015-07-31,yes,Premium Economy,Couple Leisure,L.A to Hong Kong,July 2015,2,5,5,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Cathay went the extra mile yesterday when they contacted ground staff at Paris CDG to accompany me to my next flight (not Cathay) because of a very short connection time.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"I recently flew Cathay Business Class from Singapore to London and back, via Hong Kong - a total of four sectors. While three of these flights varied from acceptable to quite good, the final leg from Hong Kong back to Singapore was awful. Having arrived late (see below) from London, we boarded yet another delayed flight only to find that, without any prior notification to us, they had switched the aircraft from the one on which we had booked our seats to one with the old A330 series 2-3-2 Business Class configuration. Not only is this more like sitting in Premium Economy, my wife and I were now separated by a passenger in the centre seat between us, with whom we had to negotiate a swap. With the flight already twenty minutes late, it was then announced that we had to wait for connecting passengers from yet another delayed Cathay flight, and we eventually pushed back from the gate 50 minutes late. Once airborne things didn't improve. While the crew were courteous enough, the food was an absolute disgrace for Business Class. We both had to send our dried-out, tough and tasteless fish entrees back, and the replacement noodles had all the attributes of a convenience store offering. The toilets, which began the flight having seen better days, were filthy by the end of it, with discarded paper overflowing from the rubbish bin and the floor wet. I will avoid flying Cathay Pacific in future for fear of encountering another flight like this one. It's a shame, because their new Business seat is actually very well thought out, and the touch-screen entertainment system excellent. But for me there's just too much risk of delays, poor food, and encountering the outdated 2-3-2 Business Class cabin to warrant the asking price. Out of our four sectors, push-back from the gate was delayed on three of them by 60, 40 and 50 minutes respectively. I hope we were just unlucky, because these statistics don't make good reading: 75% of our flights delayed by an average of 50 minutes.",0,2,Jon Morgan,2015-07-25,no,Business Class,Business,Hong Kong to Singapore,July 2015,1,1,3,3,1,Cathay Pacific Airways

Typical reason ""due to late arrival of aircraft"" which is euphemistic for ""just wait a while."" Cant-be Specific, or (ahem) Cathay Pacific reps, when I told them I needed to get home tonight from Hong Kong, but now there was no gate and only an estimated time two hours hence, offered instead for me to fill out a ""feedback form.""

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Was travelling two adults and two kids with seating fixed at the time of booking the tickets (and seat numbers specified on the tickets). When doing the online check in, we realized that Cathay Pacific had decided to change our seating. Of course they did not have the courtesy to inform us up about this to give us the chance to cancel the tickets and travel with another airline. So, Cathay Pacific had decided to split our family up. 1 adult is seated with 2 kids and 1 adult is seated somewhere completely different - 21 rows apart, to be precise. We found this out after normal office hours and then discovered a that Cathay Pacific only has reservations desks (as opposed to customer services desks) that you can call. Could not get their international 24 hour number to Work. Tried their Hong Kong number but after spending 15 minutes on hold I hung up. Next morning called the local reservation office in Zurich. Sorry sir, can't help with seat assignment it is a different system but you can do it yourself online (had already explained that we tried this but there were no 4 free seats together or near each other) or ask at the chek-in at the airport. As any family reading this can probably imagine, we arrived completely tired to our holiday after the long flight after plenty hassle of shuffling 2 small children back and forth in the cabin between mummy and daddy at mean times, toilet times, crying times etc. Now, we will see about the return flight after which we shall never set foot on Cathay Pacific again.",0,1,Jacob Korsgaard,2015-07-24,no,Economy Class,Family Leisure,Zurich to Hong Kong,July 2015,2,2,1,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"An A330 which I realise is not new to the CX fleet, but this aircraft was downright grubby. The padding on the seats was non-existant, and the fabric was worn and threadbare. These seats were unacceptable, and for an 8 hour flight, especially so. The cabin looked dingy and in need of a good clean. The cabin staff were are jaded as the furnishings. No sooner had we left the ground, than everyone was ordered - and I mean ordered - to close their window blinds, and they had to remain closed for the duration of the flight. So much for having a window seat. At one point, while going to the washroom, I literally had to jump out of the way of one of the cabin staff who was heading in the opposite direction, and I never received so much as a ""thanks"" as he barged past. The meals were served with all the enthusiasm of a billionaire serving in a soup kitchen - thankfully it was all over quickly. The food itself was ok - passable for economy class. Overall, this was grim. I'm seriously trying to decide whether to give up on Cathay Pacific after this. It's a shame - this used to be a great airline to fly with, but now it seems they're only interested if you travel in one of the premium cabins (I'm speaking from experience). They should take a few tips from their hosts at Doha. The inflight entertainment was passable, if it wasn't for the constant interruptions for announcements - usually for trying to sell bits and pieces, or announcements between the crew.",0,1,Brian McCaig,2015-07-22,no,Economy Class,Couple Leisure,Doha to Hong Kong,July 2015,1,3,4,1,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

The seat itself has generous legroom and is very comfortable with a nose wheel camera view in the InFlight Entertainment.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Overall a great airline. The check-in process is my only complaint after may years of flying with them. I carry an instrument with me when I fly that is oversized. It fits in the overhead bins and does not take up more room in the end than your average suitcase but the dimensions are odd. The last time I flew the check-in staff said there was absolutely no way I could bring it on board. We argued back and forth, got managers involved, threatened to change our flights. Eventually we got approval. A previous time I flew Cathay I booked my ticket at the last minute due to a medical emergency with my wife. I had a 50 minute layover in Tokyo, but that was the best I could do. I went to the airport the night before to try and be put on standby on a flight that evening so I would certainly make my connection. I have never been treated so poorly. Nobody would listen to what was going on. Everyone just said no and walked away. Turns out the flight was not even full, they were just not willing to help. The flights are wonderful however. The planes are well-maintained and seats are comfortable. Staff are quite attentive and friendly. The food was decent for airplane food. In-flight entertainment was as good as any I have experienced.

Unfortunately we ran through a lot of clear air turbulence during the night but we need to be reminded that this is not the fault of the airline that such meteorological phenomenon occur. The return flight in PE out of Heathrow was jammed packed but the cabin crew did their best, despite annoying fellow travellers who think it fun to recline their seats during the take off roll. On this flight, I thought again that its time passengers were allowed to tip cabin crew for good service. One again wonders why this is not allowed?

We were informed that the flight was delayed 2 hours in which originally would not allow me to connect to my connecting flight CX705 to Bangkok.

The flight was also close to full so there was little chance of having an empty seat next to a traveller. The baggage allowance for check in is only 20 kilograms: on some other airlines, it is 23 or even 30kg. Overall not particularly impressive and a case of living on their laurels.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"I had high expectations for this return flight to Melbourne based on previous reviews and for the most part Cathay didn't disappoint. I really liked the seat space and privacy. The Boeing 777 version is better than the A330 because the seat storage unit is bigger and the bed position felt wider and softer. I liked it better than BA's business class seat - especially when travelling solo. The catering was a bit hit and miss. The chilli prawns and rice out of London were excellent but a Western style chicken dish from Hong Kong was bland. In general, I think they create better Asian dishes. I've not experienced a business class meal service from a trolley before, and I'm not sure I like it. What I did find odd is that they never provided salt and pepper to season the meal. As a pre dinner drink I enjoyed trying a couple of their signature cocktails (different option on different routes). Boarding was easy, once you found the right line. The lounges in Hong Kong were good but busy. I especially liked the shower facilities and the made-to-order catering. But signage for the lounges was dire, so I struggled to find the one I was looking for at times. The lounges in London and Melbourne are also very small with no views, so I found them quite boring. Of my 4 flights, only 1 actually left on time, which was poor. The choice of inflight entertainment was a bit limited but the screen size was good (although it wasn't possible to tilt the screen for a better viewing angle). The staff were quick to respond to any requests. However, they tended to do things by rote. Once I was asked if I'd like more cashews, but that kind of spontaneity was mostly absent.

The airline's in-flight entertainment was new, but it was a 7 inch touchscreen, much smaller than the screen of my iPad. Singapore Airlines economy seats offer a 10 inch screen and also a handheld 3-4 inch touchscreen controller. There was also a USB port to charge hand phones or tablets. However, the seats don't include an A/C port or an additional USB port. The seat was newly designed with this adjustable head rest. Unfortunately, the leg room was limited and it doesn't have a foot rest For supper, we had salmon and it was delicious. The service is okay.",0,7,Edmond Luu,2015-06-21,yes,Economy Class,Family Leisure,San Francisco to Hong Kong,November 2014,3,4,4,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Great check in and lounge. Seat very comfortable. Service excellent and attentive. Chief purser come to chat to all pax. Food and drinks great.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"The flight time was very short, cabin was okay. Disappointed when it came to food choice. It was a congee with some meat and didn't look very appetizing. For the drinks you get a tetra pak of oolong tea which has been the standard for a long time. The service was done fast, so i can't say much about that. The cabin was fine as usual with clean seats, the lavatories were clean most of the time.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"CX's regional business class seats are quite uncomfortable. The seats slide forward and recline only midway, so it's difficult to remain in position without sliding. I felt a lot of pressure on my legs just to keep me on my seat. On this particular flight, the seats were configured 2-2-2, but I've flown this route before where the seats were configured 2-3-2 (worse). No privacy. The seats are not wide enough and are so close together that I could feel my neighbour's every move. You also have to share elbow space with your neighbour. When there are drinks on the elbow area, you have to stay upright so as not to hit two glasses on that same space. Since there is no storage, your neighbour's meal menu, magazine or iPad will also be in your space. This is awful for a 3-hour flight, unacceptable for business class, more fit for premium economy. The toilets are also cramped. This is really light years away from CX long haul business class. They use planes with business class cabins configured for long haul flights on the Hong Kong-Haneda route or the shorter Hong Kong-Manila route, surely they can do the same for the Hong Kong-Narita route.",0,6,Richard Ante,2015-06-18,yes,Business Class,Solo Leisure,Narita to Hong Kong,May 2015,1,4,5,5,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Very disappointed in Cathay's economy product, which is more 3 than 5 star, certainly on regional routes. The seat pitch was tight and the cabin interior looked old and dated. The food was very basic (chicken and rice plus fruit salad) and drinks choices also limited. The best things about Cathay are the inflight entertainment and the cabin crew service. They seemed genuinely upset when I told them how bad I thought their product was compared to the likes of Emirates and Qatar. I filled in a feedback form and received a standardised, rather complacent, email reply. The flight was delayed an hour (not Cathay's fault) and I would think twice about flying economy class with Cathay again.",0,4,D Brown,2015-06-16,no,Economy Class,Solo Leisure,Shanghai to Hong Kong,January 2015,1,N/A,3,5,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

I will review these flights separately. BA from Manchester to London: Good, short flight. On time. Comfortable. Good service. BA from London to Hong Kong: Excellent. Upstairs in an A380. Quiet. Comfortable. Good food. Attentive service. On -time. Couldn't have been better. Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong to Auckland: Delayed (about an hour). Uncomfortable (bucket type seats). Noisy aircraft (A340). Poor food. Staff were not particularly friendly. Cathay Pacific from Auckland to Hong Kong: Delayed by 3 hours. Uncomfortable (bucket type seats). Noisy aircraft (A340). As I missed my BA flight because of the delayed Cathay Pacific flight, I was put up in a lovely airport hotel (Regal) by Cathay Pacific. Well-organised. 5 minutes walk from the airport. Breakfast voucher included. Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong to London: Slightly delayed, but not the fault of CP. Comfortable, quiet aircraft (777). Good service.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Cathay is generally very good all around and this trip was down a notch or two for a few reasons : food quality was not up to standard out of LHR  or NRT, though not as bad out of HKG. On HKG-LHR leg though they did not have enough mid-flight meals for all passengers, which I find hard to fathom given people are paying thousands for the ticket and the meal only costs Cathay a few quid to produce. They should overstock, not understock the flight. The other complaint on the trip was the regionally configured plane from NRT-HKG is a poor excuse for business class on a four hour leg. No reason not to run flat beds on that route, considering the importance of it and the fact that some flights are overnight. Won't pay for that again. On the positive side, Cathay service always top notch and efficient.",0,7,J Rose,2015-06-14,yes,Business Class,Business,LHR to NRT via HKG,June 2015,4,2,4,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,We travelled on 13/4/2015 CX0104 Melb to Hong Kong to Paris Rome to Hong Kong to Melb Premium Economy. My husband was a first time flyer and very nervous about flying. We were shocked when we found we were separated with our seating and they did nothing to change it and we were put in front of the balk head on two of the legs. The food was very ordinary and Economy got the same menu we had to use the economy toilets we didn't have priority boarding on all legs. Cabin staff were very scarce throughout all legs unless they were going from business to the rear of the plane. The final straw was we were given a chocolate with one of our meals and couldn't believe it was 2 years out of date. We were given our last meal 2hrs before we landed at 12 o'clock at night which was unacceptable as we were going home to bed at that time.,0,1,Shirley Haag,2015-06-06,no,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,1,N/A,2,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,We debated the value of Premium Economy for ages before booking our return flights Melbourne to Europe however the added value from the price increase was truly substantial. Much better seat room for both width and recline. Great in-flight service with some really excellent food (albeit average out of Hong Kong) and priority boarding and check-in. The only minor disappointment is the very limited selection of in-flight recent movies. Enough to keep us occupied for both journeys but really not a great deal of choice overall. TV selections and music was better but nothing spectacular.,0,10,Daniel ODonoghue,2015-06-06,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Traveled CX826 Hong Kong 1/5/2015. We started to load late then once we were boarding everyone came forward the whole plane was boarding in one line while a hostess went up the line stamping boarding passes - we must have stood waiting for a good 45 mins. We were in the second last row so we had to struggle past all the others to get to our seats. This flight takes 15 hours so we got two meals in total they did bring a snack but they closed all the blinds and turned off all the lights what snacks there were you couldn't see.,0,2,John Heatly,2015-06-04,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,2,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Travelled on CX100 to Paris on 16 April 2015 and returned CX111 14th May economy class. Both flights were full except for a couple of seats. Overall my trip was average. Limited number of toilets for that many people. Food was minimal and bland compared to other airlines. On my first leg of the trip the sound was not working and the only choice I had was to move to the very back of the plane. It totally spoilt my trip. There was no foot peddle to rest your feet on so the pressure is reduced to the back of the legs. This is very important for 'short people' to reduce the risk of DVT. All other airlines flying the long leg have them. The water given to passengers was very metallic in taste and not drinkable. When we flew out of Hong Kong the security staff suddenly set up a barrier just before entering the plane and confiscated all the passengers water bottles and duty free bottles. How is this acceptable when the duty free stores sell you alcohol only to have this confiscated before boarding. They said this was an Australian ruling. A number of people requested bottles of water when entering the cabin but were refused. Why wasn't there an announcement before entering the aircraft that bottled water was not allowed. I would not have bought my new bottle and OJ prior to boarding. We could only get the 'metal tasting water'. The crew were accommodating but that's all. The seat in front of me did not stay completely upright. The man sitting in it was large but I felt that he would collapse in my lap any moment. The maintenance for the aircraft could have been better.,0,2,A Kidd,2015-05-31,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,4,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Travelled Melbourne to London Heathrow via Hong Kong (and return) in business with my elderly mother and my husband. The flights were all busy with the exception of the last leg from Hong Kong to Melbourne however the staff could not have been more helpful. They went out of their way to pay special attention to my mother ensuring she was comfortable and entertained. The service was excellent and the food and wine tasty and very well presented. One of the best things about Cathay business class apart from the service is the space. Plenty of space for everything and seat reclines to a comfortable bed. We would recommend Cathay and will definitely use them again.,0,9,Andrea Lemmon,2015-05-31,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I travelled Nagoya to Hong Kong - plane and service were good. However flight from Hong Kong to Auckland was very disappointing. We sat on the plane waiting for about an hour before it could take off. Flight attendants were slow to offer refreshments. I had to ask for a drink as the middle section of the row where I was sitting missed out despite people in front and behind getting drinks. No apology. The guy next to me asked for a water as well which he got at the same time as I got my drink and he asked for a water for his wife next to him which she never got. Overnight no one came around offering water and I had to press the crew service button for someone to take my breakfast tray away as we were descending in to Auckland. There was a good selection on IFE but it would've been better if there were more comedy films - most seemed to be drama and the controls were old school with the remote rather than touch screen and it wasn't clear how to adjust the volume or screen brightness. The information screen on the IFE didn't explain this info I had to read through the inflight magazine in the seat pouch. Very disappointing flight and end to an otherwise enjoyable holiday. I won't be flying long-haul via Cathay Pacific again.,0,1,M White,2015-05-31,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,1,N/A,1,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Two trips - LHR-HKG-ICN in April return and one way from ICN-LHR in May - all in Business. First return trip was perfect - 10/10. Very comfortable business class seat and bed good food and attentive service. Only improvement could be to the choice of movies. First trip from ICN-LHR was particularly noteworthy as the first leg was 2.5 hours late due to a thunder storm in Seoul - flight landed in HKG 10 mins after CX255 was supposed to leave but Cathay held that flight which was very impressive and lucky. The ground staff were excellent. The ICN-LHR trip in May was not so fortunate. Due to ATC restrictions over China all flights to Europe were subject to creeping delays - i.e. 30 mins at a time. With the exception of our flight all flights boarded and eventually left - some were up to 4 hours delayed. For some reason CX255 was the only flight not called for boarding and eventually after 5am (4h30m after scheduled departure) the board stated it was est at 0900 the reason being the mandatory crew hours had been reached. I suspect the decision to hold our flight was more about aircraft rotation as that particular aircraft sits on the ground at LHR for 12 hours so effectively CX255 withstand a long delay without suffering a knock on impact to Cathay's schedule. Eventually the flight took off at 0945. Whilst I accept the delay itself was not under Cathay's control the decision to withhold CX255 was not communicated and all passengers were made to wait in the terminal through the night without any offer of accommodation. When on board the flight was perfectly comfortable but my previously flawless image of Cathay's service levels is now tainted.,0,6,S Sankar,2015-05-31,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX101 25 May HKG-SYD Airbus 330 Seat 60C. 4 cabin crew members for the whole economy aisle working in pairs. Heavy rain rocky climb so service started later than usual. Crew members working in pairs efficient co- ordinated yet courteous. In the 2nd meal service passengers asleep were woken up gently so as to revert seat back for passengers behind them to eat. Only 5 toilets for the whole economy section. Food of course meagre it is economy class. Seat pitch acceptable. Enjoyable flight. All needs catered for. Due to it being an overnight flight did not try the IFE opted for some sleep instead.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Two of us flew premium economy over a two month period from LHR-Hong Kong HK-Sydney Perth-Hong Kong and Hong Kong-London. Cathay are to be commended on allowing customers seat selection long before you fly at no cost (unlike BA). Staff make this airline - plenty of them attentive smiling and enjoying their job. Throughout the flights the staff are very responsive to any request from your seat for food or assistance. Dinners/lunches are excellent with perfect fish & steaks a great selection of wines/beers and an open galley with a full selection of snacks fruit and drinks. Breakfasts offer a good selection of fruit yoghurt roll and western/eastern options but the sausages are awful! Our last leg was delayed badly by horrendous weather in Hong Kong and although the crew made up for it once airborne it would really help passengers if clear concise information was given to the passengers waiting at the gate. This is a problem with all airlines - no information when things go wrong. IFE was very good premium economy seats are very comfortable and sleeping is easy. Toilet in premium economy is very helpful as is priority boarding ahead of economy. Finally the bag drop off in Hong Kong/Kowloon way ahead of your flight is incredibly convenient. Never lost a bag yet! Good luck Cathay Pacific.,0,8,M Mingis,2015-05-27,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Very disappointed. The food was terrible staff didn't remove trays. Toilet on one leg at the front of the cabin had to climb over the four front passengers to get to it. On the other leg toilet shared with economy. The only difference to economy is 8 seats across as opposed to 9 in economy. Not a match on Qantas and not worth the money.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Business class CX135 HK to Melbourne 13 May 2015. We were coming off a 6 hour stopover from London and having spent the time in their Wings lounge. Good amenities and a great shower. The food and drinks selection was great. Tried an Asian soup from the Noodle bar and was nice. Boarding was a breeze and once on board the pampering begun. We had seats 20 D & G in the centre in the smaller rear cabin. Quiet and no through traffic. The service was excellent and the food and wine selection was just as good. Only a 9 hour flight so a quick movie and a few hours of sleep and its another excellent breakfast. One small issue was the head female attendant was very heavy handed on the perfume and I think that in a confined space like a plane very little or no perfume should be worn by staff or passengers as it can really effect people around you. Overall very happy with Cathay Pacific product and would fly with them again.,0,9,W Coenik,2015-05-20,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Flew CX110 SYD-HKG 11 May then KA896 HKG-PVG. Only 40 minutes in transfer between flights. I thought I would miss the connection. On disembarking a sign with the words ""Passenger to Shanghai"" written with a ground staff grouping all Shanghai bound passengers about 5 of us through security express lane then to boarding lounge. This is where CX/KA shine. Had it not been for their expedient service passengers would not have made such a tight connection within 30 minutes since the arrival flight was 10 minutes late. When arrived at the boarding lounge passengers were lining up for boarding. We could just make it. I wonder if Qantas would do the same. In terms of in flight services very friendly. When asked for an extra drink the attendant would come back with one remembering my seat no. Seat pitch acceptable IFE with much to choose from.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Have used this airline fairly extensively as I live in China but my family are in the UK. Found the experience in Business Class somewhat lacking so switched to another airline for a couple of years before trying Cathay again for convenience. Two Hong Kong - Manchester return flights over a three month period left a very bitter taste. Only allowed a very frugal 30kg of luggage in Business Class the Wing Lounge at HK is dirty with worn out furniture tasteless inadequate food on offer that is infrequently replenished managed by sour faced staff. Only Western type meal on board in Business Class was a very small pizza not what I would call an evening meal and insufficient hot breakfast so I went without. On a return flight Business Lounge at Manchester little more than a pokey airless hole with very little on offer. Small baby in Business that proceeded to scream for around 11 hours of the flight and whilst as a mother I am sympathetic to this I haven't paid a small fortune to listen to this in Business Class. Cathay are one of the most expensive Business Class options yet offer sub-standard menus dismal Lounges inadequate baggage allowance and insufficient attention to Business Class travellers who pay for a service that is decidedly lacking!,0,1,C Sorour,2015-05-20,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,1,N/A,2,1,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Business CX250 London to HK 11 May 2015. Check in at London a breeze. Off to the lounge and a 15 minute walk to the gate. Not complaining as about to sit for 13 hours. Once on board had seats 17K and 18K. The service was excellent and the meals and wine selection was also excellent. Nothing was too much trouble. The inflight entertainment was up to date with the latest movies. Once dinner was over and a few movies it was time to try out their beds. Would not say they are the most comfortable lay flat beds that I have tried but still comfortable enough to grab a few hours sleep. Next morning breakfast was another excellent affair. We were transiting through HK so no baggage to pick up so off to the Wings Club for 6 hours.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Travelled BOM-HKG-PVG and return last week and had a good experience. Food was good and so was the inflight entertainment. Their sister company Dragonair which operated the HKG to PVG leg of the journey was also good especially compared to other Chinese airlines such as China Eastern/Air China which I had used in the past. PVG airport is notorious for flight delays - I happened to reach the airport about 2.5 hours before my scheduled departure. My flight was supposedly going to be delayed & the check in lady offered me an earlier flight if I was ok. I did so gladly and I think that it saved me from missing the connection from HKG. 5 stars to that.,0,9,G Kiran,2015-05-18,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,HKG-EWR on frequent flyer ticket. Cathay business layout good for solo travellers and a lie-flat seat I could sleep in. Entertainment was heavy on middle of the road stuff. Good amenity kit. Staff professional although not personal. The main criticism is food. The heating of all elements in a single serving dish is not up with best practice and the results on all meals was mediocre quality.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Just completed an open jaw YVR-HKG-MNL-HKG-LAX combination of Economy and Business Class. I have become very familiar with Cathay's hard products already so I am more keen on the service aspect. Flying out of YVR on CX837 crew were primarily Vancouver-based. Service was top-notch as what one would expect from the World's Best Airline. It is true that the cabin crew were not so visible at the cabin after meal times but press the call button and crew very eager to help will be on your side in a few seconds. Nothing is too much trouble for them even given the most demanding set of passengers-just absolutely polished service. All this applies to all of the sectors I have flown. Only comment probably will be the food-the serving are soo small in Y thanks to the endless bags of chips nuts fruits and chocolate bars in the galley I was able to survive the 13-hour trek across the Pacific Ocean. Overall Cathay is Cathay - the World's best and they continue to deliver these kinds of products and services other airlines can't match.,0,10,R Benedicto,2015-05-11,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,From Chicago to Hong Kong - the airlines bumped me to Business Class which was great. Hong Kong to Perth sat in purchased premium economy awful! Service was worse than any economy flight I've flown! Meat was so tough I had to shred it and attendants never came by to provide drinks during meal so I had the half cup of warm water! They served 1/2 cup of coffee well after the meal and never returned to offer more cups were still at my seat when the next meal was served! The flight was not full so economy passengers were stretched out to sleep by putting up arm rests which cannot be done in premium economy due to trays being stored in the arm rests. Seats are difficult to push back for anyone not weighing much such as me! So either pay for business class or settle for economy! Staff never strolled through cabin to see if anyone needed anything.,0,3,Carol Weingart,2015-05-10,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,1,N/A,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Hong Kong-Rome 2 weeks ago then Zurich-Hong Kong yesterday both on brand new B77W and delayed 1hr each. I fly with CX quite often for long-haul journey only because 1-good safety record 2-low or reasonable fare. Fully understand that I shouldn't expect anything good for other service since it's economy class that's why I bring my own food every time (CX is cutting cost so hard to reduce the food quality and quantity) seat is uncomfortable and no service from cabin crew except the dinner/light breakfast time. AVOD is very good.,0,8,Steven Cao,2015-05-08,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,2,N/A,3,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Cebu to HK (CX926) check in was fast and friendly clean newest aircraft seat comfortable no champagne food was exactly the same as economy class quite disappointed really. In my humble opinion it just not worth flying premium class for a two hour trip. HK to London (CX255) quite disappointed compare to my excellent flight to HK The seats was a little worn and hard the cabin had a lot of scruff marks one hot towel before dinner and one hot towel before breakfast dinner was good breakfast wasn't. Hardly saw any cabin crew between dinner and breakfast. I really do feel they need to make the premium class a little bit special small touches such as proper cups for tea or coffee proper glass and not plastic cup for drinks armchair style seats perhaps in leather would be nicer the TV was awkward to raise (seat 30G) dinner tray was a tad too small charging point for mobile phone was awkward.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,JFK-HKG-CMB-HKG-JFK B777-300ER and A330-300 JFK-HKG in First and the three other flight segments in Business Class. One World Mileage Redemption Award through AA. JFK check-in was excellent and CX uses the BA First Class Lounge that has room for improvement to be more like LHR T5. Boarding was not well organized but First Class on board was outstanding as always though the menu selections aren't quite as good as a few years ago. The wines and other beverage choices were excellent. Hong Kong's CX Wing First Class Lounge was excellent and their Cabanas are great for rest and showering/bathing. The non-stop flight from HKG to CMB had the new Business Class seats while the flight back from CMB to HKG had Regional Business Class seats due to a one hour stop in BKK therefore not considered long haul. The new Business Class seat (was also on the plane from HKG-JFK) is very well designed with much storage space though the cushion is not the softest and there is an awkward angled step in the foot well floor just in front of the footrest. Meal service was good and the staff was efficient while most were friendly and helpful. All the planes were clean and the toilets were maintained well throughout the flights. I used the UL Serendib Lounge in CMB due to my OW Emerald Tier status knowing that the Araliya Lounge used by most airlines is very average. Luggage transferred without any problems and was delivered promptly. JFK Immigration and Customs staff was efficient and polite. Will definitely use CX again as I have regularly since 2008.,0,9,B Wijesinghe,2015-05-06,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX731 HKG-DXB Business Class. I had booked a one way ticket in Premium Economy using the last of my Asiamiles which were expiring soon. I have been a CX Marco Polo club member since inception and flew business and first regularly when I was based in Hong Kong several years ago. But being based in Dubai for the past few years I had not flown CX in a long while. To my delight and surprise when I checked in at the airport in HKG the check-in agent gave me a business class boarding card. I was surprised because my ticket was not a full revenue ticket and had been purchased with miles. This is what sets CX apart from the rest. Unlike other airlines including one prominent one from SE Asia CX remembers your loyalty even from way back in the past and rewards passengers like myself. This has happened to me several times when I was based in HKG but to do this to a formerly loyal passenger on a non-revenue ticket simply took my breath away. Needless to say the service and food were flawless and I greatly enjoyed my trip. Thank you CX! I will always remember this.,0,10,Sanjay Modak,2015-05-04,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Business Class Sydney-Hong Kong-Paris: Zurich-Hong Kong-Sydney. The overall experience was faultless. The seating arrangement was equal or better than other first class offerings we have experienced. It was 1-2-1 seating arrangement and my wife and I each chose a window seat as it offered maximum privacy. Every imaginable position was comfortable be it sitting sleeping or anywhere in between. Storage compartments for every feasible object positioned conveniently all around. Plenty of good lighting options for whatever you choose to do. Cabin crew service was attentive friendly and professional. Food and drinks all of a high standard with any little extra requirement taken care of if at all possible.,0,10,N Duncan,2015-05-04,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Having flown the very long haul JFK-HKG flight (15 hours) with the newer reclining seats and the older shell seats on short HKG-MNL flight (2 hours) the newer reclining seats are uncomfortable and have no privacy. The shell design seats were more comfortable between the two. The newer seat design reclines six inches right onto your knees if you are an average sized person. So much so I had to notify the flight attendant to instruct the person sitting in front of me not to recline fully because I literally could not move. This is inexcusable. The seat pad is so thin the underside of my legs began to ache in an hour with a genuinely painful posterior another hour later. There is little privacy with these seats because the seatback tops are small and have space gaps between them that put the AV screen in the next row in your line of sight. It is even worse when the person in front reclines. The miniature storage caddy below the AV screen is handy for storing glasses small documents etc though it protrudes a bit too much into the personal space in front of the seat. All-in-all these seats were poorly designed and tested and very uncomfortable for long haul flights. The recline needs to be reduced to 3 inches more and better padding is needed for the seat cushions and adjustments needs to be made to reduce the protrusion of the seatback in front of you into your personal space. The storage caddy sticks out too far the seatback pocket area as well. The rails that attach the seat to the plane on the floor are not positioned for seat comfort either. The fixed shell seats HKG-MNL were more comfortable because of the pseudo leather material covering them. Also the top of the seat was fuller giving one more privacy from the AV screens and passengers sitting in the next row. It seemed like they had an extra inch of pitch compared to the newer reclining seats but that may be just because of the limited simpler seatback design (no storage caddy). Food all the way through was average to below average. A fifteen hour flight ought to have three meals rather than the two they served. In the many hours in between meals there were few snacks and they disappeared quickly and were not replenished. The snacks were highly salty such as the heavily blanched peanuts. Several bags of them almost made you dehydrate. They did not taste right. I made the mistake of ordering a kosher meal on one segment and it was very bland and had stiff tasteless crackers. The one that had salmon had been pilfered so they returned it for a regular meal. The seatback AVOD needs to have more classic movie selections documentaries etc. It is also too difficult to navigate the AVOD screen and one often has to press the touch screen several times to get a button to take. Service on the flights was above average. The flight attendants and pilot crew were professional efficient and pleasant. While they were very busy the flight attendants were responsive as they could be in such a busy atmosphere. The gate agents were pleasant attentive to detail and efficient. All the CX we encountered were above average in their professionalism and service. If it were not for very uncomfortable seats and their lack of privacy and the below average food and inadequate snacks the service would lift the experience to 4 of 5 stars. CX needs to customer test the seats and food and improve them to be a four or five star experience.,0,5,S Truax,2015-05-02,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,4,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Premium economy service downgraded. I have been a regular customer on Cathay Pacific's premium economy between Perth and Hong Kong and I have been very happy with the service until now. On my last flight Perth to Hong Kong instead of the usual hot or cold breakfast options we were given a box containing a pastry fruit salad in a tiny dish and a chocolate bar The same meal was served to economy passengers. when I asked the flight attendant where was the hot food I was informed that there had been a change to the service. Downgrade more like it. I asked for a glass of Champagne and that was served in a plastic cup. On the return sector Perth to Hong Kong we were given a hot lunch which was quite good and then around 9pm they came down with a box containing the worlds smallest chicken roll some fruit salad in a tiny plastic container and a chocolate bar. Cathay Pacific is a premium airline this food is not fit for economy let alone premium economy. They seem to have downgraded the service but not discounted the price of the ticket. I will be flying back to Hong Kong next week it will be interesting to see if they have lifted the standard of meals back to what it once was.,0,5,A Godfrey,2015-04-27,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,3,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,My wife and I flew from Helsinki via Frankfurt and Hong Kong to Ho-Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Flight from HEL to FRA was operated by Finnair and was comfortable as always although the menu prices (especially for drinks) are completely ridiculous. The long legs FRA-HKG-HMC (and back) were operated by Cathay and I must say that I really enjoyed flying with them. The service was excellent and food was really good (comparable to Emirates). IFE was excellent with a pretty wide choice of movies which partly were at that time still showing in the cinemas in Finland. Best part of the flight was the seat. I'm approx. 1.90m tall so I appreciate the room that Cathay is giving the passengers even in Economy. Additionally seats were very comfortable and wide so I could get a good sleep on the long-haul flights. We ran into some pretty heavy turbulence somewhere over the Himalayas and the captain was constantly making announcements as to what was happening. After it was getting too tough they decided to change the route which eventually resulted in a slightly delayed arrival in HKG but a much more relaxed flight. I'm already looking forward to flying Cathay again this year and can highly recommend the airline.,0,10,Henning Hietaniemi,2015-04-24,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,4,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Hong Kong - Sydney (CX139 - Boeing 777-300ER 3 Class). An overall excellent flight with an excellent selection of movies music and games on the seatback IFE. Food was excellent and was presented in a way that make it look like something that is edible. Cathay has never fails to deliver the service needed for a five star airline. The seats were comfortable enough allowing me to catch up on my sleep. However this time around the cabin crew seemed annoyed but did the best to hide it. It was noticeable that the FA's were tired and wished to go to sleep at anytime. But they did their best to hide it which is commendable.,0,9,J Wang,2015-04-23,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,4,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX252 12 March 2015 LHR-HKG. An excellent service in economy class. Personally being taller than average I miss the clam seat since if the person in front reclines the restriction in legroom is annoying. Unlike other airlines it is not leg breaking just annoying. Food and entertainment are excellent in flight snack selection is 1st class (noodle soup and fresh fruit) and staff are superb. A model for any other airline - don't fly everywhere but make sure the service you supply where you do fly is tip-top regardless of class. Even better - the entertainment system takes standard headphone jack so you can bring your own. Its a long old flight but Cathay make me wish it lasted another two or three hours.,0,10,Hung Mung,2015-04-23,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"CX736 and CX715 from SIN to HKG. I have to say I've been on a few flights in the past year and in my opinion Cathay Pacific is comparable to a low cost carrier. I've been on All Nippon Airways and Korean Air and I expected that Cathay Pacific would do much better since it's been regarded as the best airline in the world so of course I would have high expectations. But no and here's why: 1) I did not feel welcome from the moment I checked in up to the point I exited the aircraft the atmosphere was ""cold"" to say the least. Half of the cabin crew were robotic and the service felt really off to me. 2) Food there was no problem with the dinner they served but what annoyed me was the fact that their cutlery was made of plastic. I hate eating with plastic forks and spoons and I was appalled that a five star airline would have the audacity to use plastic tools for people to eat with. 3) In- flight entertainment not up to standard; the content was fine but the equipment was not. It is exactly the type that Jetstar uses and I hate the fact that there were no buttons and that everything was touchscreen. My complaints may seem petty to some individuals but I strongly believe that these three components are some of the basic foundation that defines an airline.",0,5,Tarmidzi Jamson,2015-04-19,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,2,N/A,2,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

Beside getting the excellent service from ground staff and flight attendants the rest of my experience was no good. Flight was delayed for almost three hours from HCMC-HK then delayed for 1.5 hours from HK-HCMC. Selection of beverages was minimal alcohol was not offered unless you asked for it and the inflight food was awful.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Melbourne - Shanghai via HK and return same route. Had very high expectations of this airline and class judging by the reviews here. For the most part I would have to agree. Cathay Pacific are very good airline and the business class experience is quite fine. Check in smooth and quick virtually no waiting at all and same for express card at immigration. At lounge in Melbourne we were greeted and shown the lounge and told we'd be advised when the flight was ready for boarding. Pretty good selection of reading material strong Wi-Fi and food selection both western and eastern all up a positive experience. HK lounges similar set up and look but bigger and more choices etc. On board was similarly great. Huge amount of room in overhead locker as in business you are not sharing. My jacket was taken off me without asking and stored for the flight. Offered a selection of drinks before flight and shortly after take-off personally welcomed on board. A Nice touch. Lovely hot towels before eating and after eating always a plus. The seat is exactly as you imagine. Large comfortable with plenty of room. Try as I might you just can't touch the next seat ahead of you. Controls simple and easy to use. The screen and entertainment system pretty good but I'd have to say Emirates is better for variety and information. Dinner was served pretty quickly as this was an after midnight departure. Fresh white linen is placed on tray table and simple design of unfussy crockery and cutlery. Lots of attention given with plenty of staff for the cabin always not far away should need them. On the food front I'd say it was tasty and plentiful but not exactly what I'd call luxurious but definitely a step up from economy as it should be. Breakfast approaching HK was better. Fresh juice and smoothies both cold and hot food to eat and a selection of three choices are offered. In terms of the fully reclined bed I couldn't fault the bed itself. I was surprised how far it kept going back. In fact I actually brought up slightly to give my body some support as fully flat felt a little like laying on the floor. I'd also say the cavity where you place your feet is far too hot. Both my partner and I felt a bit like our legs were on fire. That combined with the warmth of the duvet provided made it too warm. This should be addressed somehow. Disembarking is a quick and part of the advantage of flying in this class. Overall it's a very comfortable and spacious flying experience. This seat is used as a first class product by Dragon Air the sister airline and in fact the feel and cabin does feel very first class if a little spartan and pared back. Overall I'd recommend the crew airline and experience. Food cabin temperature aside it's well worth flying business class particularly if you can take advantage of the seat / bed.,0,8,N Gurciullo,2015-04-12,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flight 500 / Japan Airlines Flight 7048. HKG-NRT B777-300. Be aware that: Seats 46AK and 49AK are window seats without windows on Cathay's Boeing 777-300. Hard shells weren't too bad afterall on a short haul 4 hour flight. Although seats don't recline and the person at the front won't lean back and occupy your limited space hard shells are not comfortable when compared to other ordinary seats and I don't feel relaxed. On the other hand seat legroom was acceptable but not satisfactory enough. Seat width was good. The entertainment system or AVOD has limited choice and the screen wasn't sensitive enough. The AC power socket provided was not working at my seat. For the food it was Fish w/ Rice or Chicken w/ Pasta both with salad bread a drink and Haagen Dazs as dessert. The crew were friendly and willing to help. In general the flight was on time and was earlier than expected. Everything was OK and above average and were up to standards as a 5-star airline. However there is still room for improvement. CX is reliable and I will travel with CX again.,0,6,N Ronald,2015-04-12,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,4,N/A,4,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I have travelled on CX flights every year since 2004 and I am a Marco Polo member but I do not find any difference in the staff service. When I asked for a comment form the flight managers kept asking to find out what comments I would be writing. Though I had asked for a change of seats on 2 of my flights because there were empty seats. I was told to wait until the door was closed. I waited but the seats were taken by other passengers before the airplane's door was closed though I asked before them. When I was upgraded to business class the hostess chose to give me the noodles burnt and oily dumplings for breakfast. When I asked for a noodle snack (in premium economy) the hostess refused to serve me claiming that breakfast would be served in an hour (actually 1.5 hours later). The staff did not ask what drinks I would like and they just served whatever they liked.,0,2,KY Wong,2015-04-12,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,2,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Sydney to Hong Kong. Regular CX passenger. Chaotic boarding which is unusual. Bus class cabin as good as ever and the new amenity kit is a vast improvement. Lovely staff although the cabin service director oddly absent Will always recommend Cathay for the consistent good crews and great hard product. Only the food is terrible and sadly that is consistent. No salt and pepper shakers in bus class is just dumb and the plastic packets you get if you ask for are too coarse and would embarrass Economy class.,0,7,LeFaucheur Alan,2015-04-08,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,1,N/A,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Bathroom is actually quite a way back in economy. Good food excellent CX service as usual they were very present during long flight making lots of runs. Very helpful with the ancient Americans who seemed to have a wide range of special needs and requests. The front section of economy is not really that different to premium.

In particular cabin crew between HKG and TPE were excellent. Connections in Hong Kong were seamless and easy with CX carrying everything off with professionalism. IFE options are varied and entertaining and the dining options seem to have improved with 3 choices for the main meal and also Haagen Dazs ice cream served for dessert.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,BNE-HKG-BNE in Premium Economy (and then to Hanoi on Hong Kong Airlines for a change). Cathay Premium Economy never seems to vary: good food good service passable wine (albeit in a plastic cup) and quite good seating. A negative is that the Cathay Pacific web-site often shows premium economy as being already completely full when looking at potential flights and selecting seats when in fact it isn't full at all. I wonder how many customers Cathay are losing because of this. They've lost me this time because of this odd problem and I will head to Hong Kong and back on Qantas next time.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,We flew LHR-HKG and HGK-SYD 11/12 January 2015. We were previously booked on Malaysian Airlines and took the option from Flight Centre to change after their misfortunes during 2014. Wish we had stayed with Malaysian. Found Cathay Pacific in-flight service and overall comfort to be far inferior to our previous international flights with both Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. In addition we booked and paid for extra leg-room on the legs to/from Australia. When checking-in at LHR I noticed that we had not been allocated these seats and to make matters worse my wife and I were allocated different rows. Upon questioning this I was told that HKG was not open at that time so take it up with them when we arrive. The flight was delayed and upon arrival in HKG we were quickly and rudely ushered to our awaiting flight to SYD. The Cathay staff at the Gate would not assist even though they admitted a mistake had been made and other people were now in the seats we paid for but they would not move them. We therefore spent the flight crammed into the middle of the middle rows in seats several rows apart. Never again will we fly with Cathay Pacific and very little positive to say based on our experiences.,0,2,Brennan Michael,2015-03-26,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,3,N/A,2,1,Cathay Pacific Airways

Lounge in BKK - considering the high number of flights the lounge is really basic. The priority pass one is much better small crowded limited food and drinks. They also allow other airlines like Sri Lankan to use it too.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,JFK-HKG-SIN return. Transpacific legs in F on the 773ER. Cathay continues to be the standard bearer for international first class travel maybe SQ the only other true contender. FAs are excellent food and drink are superb AVOD is well-stocked and diverse. Hard product is excellent from mattress pad to duvet to pillow. Slept a solid 8 hours uninterrupted on each flight. Lounges at HKG are well above average but you need to know which to visit as there are many. The Wing and The Bridge are standouts for F and J travel respectively. For flights to SIN and back 777 and A330 planes in regional 3-class configuration without F were used. J class on these flights featured the older recliner product but this was comfortable enough for the roughly 3 hour flight. Food and drink were decent far better than what's found in J on other airlines. Only place CX needs to improve is on the boarding process. Is often chaotic and poorly managed. If they can get that in order they would be the best airline in the world in my opinion.,0,10,R Paterson,2015-03-25,yes,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I flew from SYD to LHR in Premium Economy. I was very disappointed. I paid the extra over economy for the extra legroom (tick) but also for the dedicated bathroom and premium service. On the SYD to HK leg we had to use the crowded economy toilets. The HKG to LHR we had a decimated bathroom - but lengthy queue as economy passengers were waking up and using it. This was not policed by the flight attendants. The food was also the same as economy with no top up of your wine during dinner. Overall not worth the extra. Cathay should travel on Qantas Premium Economy to see how it should operate.

Yes you could complain that the attendants aren't running around after you like they do in business but that's churlish.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew LHR-HKG-SYD-HKG-LHR all on Cathay in business for the first time usually fly BA. Overall quite good. Good things: IFE good but not out of this world - same programming on short programmes for all legs but films varied although quite safe. Comedy section good classics but limited and again very PC. Planes clean. Comfortable seats although (see my not so good) but nice space and storage. Cabin temperature not too cold not too hot. Service attentive and really worked hard. Toilets always clean. Food - This was the one great disappointment and I eat anything! On two legs of the food was cold and had to reheat. Choices really limited taste not great - really tasted like plane food rather than business class plane food. Servings small and presentation poor. Seats a little lumpy even though they get great write-ups would greatly benefit from a mattress didn't sleep much - I really don't know who else I can try as they all seem like this.,0,8,M Roberts,2015-03-17,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,2,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew Dubai - Hong Kong - Bali and return. All in all fantastic flights. Service and crew on all flights were absolutely superb. Flat beds on the DXB-HKG sectors are amongst the best in the sky. The 'regional' business class seat on the HKG - Bali flights adequate for flights up to about five hours and during the day (I wouldn't be able to sleep in one though). Food was average - not Cathay's strong point. Lounges in Hong Kong good although the staff there seem a bit stand off-ish. Used a cabana in the first class Wing lounge and it was fantastic. Food also good. Would definitely choose Cathay ahead of other airlines.,0,8,D Jason,2015-03-17,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew DXB-HKG-BNE return all on the A330-300. Much better price than EK even though its not non stop. Service is excellent the business cabin seats are very comfortable with flat lie beds same style as AA's new B777-300. Food is good and plenty of it. The cabin crew on all legs were friendly and efficient. IFE is good nice big screens and a good enough selection. Didn't spend much time in the lounges in HK but of the time spent they are good. CX use the BA lounge in DXB which is just about ok. In BNE they use the Qantas lounge which is again ok apart from the rude staff.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Geneva to Hong Kong and return via London in C-Class. Outbound was ok but nothing special. Return was really poor.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew SYD-HKG HKG-EWR JFK-HKG HKG-SYD between Feb 9 to Mar 1. First time flying with this airline a really pleasant experience. Paid AU$1600 five months in advance making it only $400 for each long flight great value. Ground and flight crew were all professional and hospitable. Ticked all the right boxes in terms of IFE catering seat comfort and cabin cleanliness. Enjoyed the view via the exterior camera flying over Alaska and Greenland on the 777-300ER.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Seats were quite comfy movie choice was good music choice was however quite poor unless you are a big fan of Kpop or Chinese music.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Having flown a number of legs on CX recently I've been mostly impressed by both the seats and the service. I flew on the B777-300 ER and the regional A330 and the service was good on all legs. The seats on the long haul B777s are excellent with plenty of storage space and an excellent entertainment system with a huge choice of movies TV and music. My only disappointment was with the food. The choice is limited (no choice offered for appetisers this always appears to be a form of smoked salmon) and having sampled most of the dishes offered none were particularly impressive. This appears to be at odds with the level of service offered by the airline. The food at the lounges in HKIA in particular at The Wing remains excellent. Other than the average food CX are an excellent airline and the seats and service are about as good as it gets in the air.,0,7,S Auld,2015-03-04,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,2,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Our kids are scattered around the world to the extent that the best way to visit them is a round-the-world ticket which makes for a horrendous trip. No trip is without it's troubles: in flight problems being rough weather screaming baby kicking your kidneys from behind / super sized passenger demanding you don't recline your seat or delays caused by drunken passengers/ flight staff not turning up / broken equipment. My aim is to look for the least unpleasant trip providers whilst doing all that I can to minimise inconvenience and discomfort for me fellow travellers and employees. Cathay Pacific seems to be the least traumatic way of doing this. I have travelled with them and many other carriers over the last fifteen years and consider them the best staff very helpful and non-confrontational when things go wrong (eg dealing effectively with abusive drunk). And I will try to avoid American Airways for the Atlantic leg who exceeded my expectations of how bad a flight could be (thankfully 'only' a short seven hour hop).,0,8,Sara Gallagher,2015-03-04,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I had written my experiences in Business Class EWR-HKG-EWR a few months ago. At that time. I wasn't impressed with the service food and everything about Cathay Pacific. I assumed that it was a fluke and used Cathay again with the same itinerary. It wasn't a fluke! I can't believe that this is one of the best business class airlines. The reviews are very good except for the North American flights. In any event I'll switch to United in the future. At least I'll know their short comings.,0,1,B Vogel,2015-03-04,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,1,N/A,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew business class from London to Sydney via Hong Kong this week. London to Hong Kong sector very comfortable with flat bed cubicle. A few things missing no PJS nor pre orderings drinks as is the case with Qantas and Virgin. Second leg HK to Sydney - huge disappointment. The airline switched aircraft's at very last minute meaning business class (read premium economy) had no flat bed cubicles just seats. No passengers were advised ahead of time and the response to my complaint letter said the airline was sorry but nothing could be done about it.,0,1,J Ward,2015-03-04,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,4,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,LHR-HKG (B777) then HKG-PER (A330) and return. Business class. (No First Class on the aircraft I used). Both aircraft's are similar from the point of view of the seat itself and the service you get although the A330 seat is slightly smaller but that is only really noticeable in the smaller side-cupboard by the seat. Storage is impressive and is everywhere. The headphone cabinet has more storage space too and it has a mirror. Seat firm but comfortable. You don't get pyjamas or a mattress with business class with Cathay only in their First Class. Initially I was miffed but actually I didn't notice not having the mattress and I slept well. The amenity kit has ear plugs anyway. Cathay dining is esoteric and not always to a western palate. It is served from a trolley so you get to see the product before you select it which is rather good. Cathay service is practical and competent but I feel that it is not polished like say BA or Emirates. I chose Cathay because I wanted the best seat for a 24 hr flight and in that respect any short-comings in other departments (food no mattress humourless but efficient staff) are insignificant: these seats will get you there in comfort. I was most impressed and will use them again. The seat does it for me - it is what makes a difference after the flight.,0,9,R King,2015-03-04,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,2,N/A,3,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Cathay did provide the best service between New York and Hong Kong. The service by the mostly Hong Kong crew was excellent. The Cathay chef knows how to concoct those airline meals. The small portions are just what I want on a long flight. If you want more there are noodles freely available. So is the champagne wine and Johnnie Walker. Everything comes with linen and silverware. The movie selection is huge and power is available for personal electronics. I usually manage to sleep half of the flight very nice. My last flight Hong Kong to JFK via Vancouver in January began well in business class but soon went downhill. I was late boarding and the head purser made me a beautiful mimosa joking that the look is what counts. It was just the kind of nice little touch which makes for a great flight. Surprisingly the food went downhill from that point. For the first meal I ordered the filet - it was cold overcooked and tough inedible. Hours later the next meal was the same. The duck was greasy stringy and tough. I noticed that the entrees were lined up open on top of the trolley before serving. Passengers at the rear got cold congealed food! Because they were slow with the service the food cooked too long then sat open the whole time. I tried to refuel with their ever available noodles but these came mushy though fragrant. Very frustrating. Except for the one purser who did not appear again the entire cabin crew was new. Looked like they are training a whole new crew for this cabin. I've flown Cathay for years and years and I know they will fix it. But meanwhile methinks Singapore or EVA for a couple of years might be good for me.,0,4,E Mshna,2015-03-04,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,1,N/A,2,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I travelled Manchester - Sydney return on 777-300 ER. The service was mediocre on 3 of the 4 legs with a poor selection of food warm champagne and no single malts. The crew were almost robotic and did not show any real deep customer care. The service was rushed and served without any finesse unlike Singapore and Emirates. The new seat/bed was ok but felt tight and squeezed in. Obviously on this airline they have crammed in as many seats as possible with no space to move around the plane. I am 1.80 in height and slim and getting in and out of my seat 17K unless the seat was completely upright was a struggle. Boarding on all 4 legs as a BC passenger was chaotic and a stress. In Hong Kong it was unbelievable. 14 staff and not one singing off the same hymn sheet. Also in HK no one welcomed us onboard either on entry or when we were seated. The crew manager spent all her time at the front of the plane and never entered to serve or speak with the passengers in any class on the HK to Manchester leg on 18 Feb 2015. She was unapproachable and aloof. The business class lounge at Manchester was a joke and in Hong Kong was nice when inside the staff were distant and robotic. In Sydney we used the Qantas lounge winch was a delight. I would not spend £3700 with this airline again but will travel Singapore or Emirates BC when I travel long haul and wouldn't use Manchester again I'll travel through Heathrow.,0,5,Millar Jeffrey,2015-02-24,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,5,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,This airline came highly recommended by friends and I think they must have flown a different airline to me. I recently had 4 international flights with Cathay all of which were late for take off. Our first flight MEL to Hong Kong (late out of MEL) was pleasant the staff were attentive the service went downhill from there. Honk Kong - New York late for take off which caused problems at the New York end having to pay a waiting fee for car service. London-Hong Kong an unpleasant trip staff tired and grumpy from the start toilets dirty and smelly and again a late take off. Hong Kong-MEL well what can I say late take off again (almost an hour). Staff should find another job if they don't want to do long haul flights unpleasant to the point of being down right rude. Toilets were absolutely disgusting. The only saving grace of this airline was the seats enough room to stretch and get some sleep. My expectation is that flights take off on time and an occasional late take off is acceptable but come Cathay 4 late take offs in one trip really is a bit much.,0,2,Griffiths Marie,2015-02-24,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,1,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I used to travel CX regularly in the decade 1984-1994 when I lived in Hong Kong. This was my first time in 20 years traveling round-trip to Melbourne from London. The lounges were generally goodwith decent Chinese food but little or no choice in wines. On board I found the seats comfortable. The service was polite and generally efficient. I didn't see much spontaneity or anticipation: You end up having to ask for what you want. The main disappointment was the food particularly from HK to Melbourne and back. It wasn't terrible but it was worse than I remember it 30 years ago. I'd certainly fly Cathay again but I was surprised not to find it better than BA.,0,7,R Vines,2015-02-24,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,3,N/A,4,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Travelled from SIN-HKG and back. Check-in counter waiting time really efficient at Hong Kong Airport Express station and Singapore is really efficient. Aboard flight good movies and TV shows shown on StudioCX and the food was very fresh and tasty. Good flight attendant service with the newest economy class. Clean cabin and toilet and quiet flying experience on Airbus A330-300.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,We flew in Business on the new direct flight from Manchester to Hong Kong. I have to say that this is the best Business Class I've flown on and is realistically just about as good as BA's First Class. The seat is huge wider than BA's First Class seat and wider than any Business Class seat bar Singapore. The food is very good (though in all fairness not great). On board entertainment is good. The seats are apart from being really really wide are amazingly simple to operate. None of the over-complicated devices that take half a flight to figure out how to use. Service is good though in one direction a bit cold and stand-offish (though still efficient). The HK lounge is good though obviously not as nice as the Cathay First Class lounge The Wing. But for Business Class pretty good indeed. The only downside is cost. This was a fair bit more expensive than most of the other Business Class options to HK though it is the only direct flight so worth the extra to avoid a change of planes. I can definitely recommend Cathay's Business Class.,0,9,R Robinson,2015-02-18,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Return flight form HKG to LAX. I have no issues with the seats and food but the service is very poor. When I got to my seat I requested one of the cabin stewardess to help me store my cabin bag. The answer I got from her was shocking she said she would do it later together with me! I can understand that she might not be strong or tall enough to (like myself) but she could either ask for another stewardess or a steward to help.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,After paying to go premium Economy we did not get any extra service. We had to use the economy toilets quite away back in the plane. We have always flown with Qantas before and the cabin crew pay a lot of attention to you even though you are Premium Economy. They came round with water and snacks. We only saw the cabin crew when we first got on the 4 planes (Heathrow to Hong Kong-Hong Kong to Brisbane and returning again) and other than for meals.,0,2,E R Hunter,2015-02-18,no,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,1,N/A,1,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Round trip First class New York (JFK) to Hong Kong (HKG) via Vancouver (YVR). In general service is as not as polished as before. Beverage options are still good. Catering is deteriorating. Compared to the same flights I took a couple of months a go Cathay cuts back significantly including: 1) Studio CX magazine a entertainment supplement for First and Business passengers. 2) They also downgrade First class amenity kit from Zegna to Aesop. The design of amenity kit is boring and the color scheme is unimpressed. 3) Cathay also cut down amuse-bouche between JFK and YVR. 4) No welcome drink departing from JFK. On the flight to HK the purser warned me that HK headquarter changed the new menu this month. They used to cater lobster and prime ribs steaks as entrée but they were replaced by fish and chicken. I tried both chicken and fish and sadly to report both are not great. CX switches crew in Vancouver. In general HK-based crew were more polished and tip-top though can be more formal. Vancouver-based are more casual laid-back and chatty which I actually prefer. Sometimes they are too casual and forget some details including refilling Champagne leading First class passengers to their seats and placing welcome card etc..… CX also fails to deplane first class passengers first and let them wait after business class passengers. Having said that the seat is spacious and comfortable.,0,4,Shannon Lee,2015-02-18,no,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,3,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Travelled on CX358 from Manchester to Singapore via Hong Kong that should have left on the 29th. The airport experienced some delays due to snow and was closed for a while. I have no problems with the delay as you can't help what the weather brings however we were boarded onto the plane where we sat for 6 hours going nowhere. Cathay have their own infrastructure in Manchester airport supplied by Airline Services who simply couldn't cope with the amount of planes that needed to be de-iced. Cathay did little to keep us informed and when the flight was subsequently cancelled we got off and put up in a Hotel in Manchester for the night. The following day we did eventually leave but the knock on effect of the delay was now felt by the flight when we arrived in Hong Kong there were no connecting flights and the ground staff were overwhelmed with trying to get us all sorted out so spent another day in HK airport. Yes the planes are comfortable the food was quite good as were the facilities but their being able to work under pressure was very disappointing and frustrating also they do not accept the fact they could have done better.,0,2,Malcolm Hartill,2015-02-18,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,1,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Sydney to Paris via Hong Kong premium economy return. I found the seats to be quite comfortable (I'm short and fat) and had little trouble in sleeping. Inflight entertainment was adequate with a wide choice of so-so titles. Service was really quite bad with two ""forgotten"" drink requests and one missing meal over four sectors. Staff were polite but incompetent and always flustered. Food was simply bad. There were times when I though the PE fare not worth the money but walking into economy and then into business put that that right. Premium economy is just what you'd expect: it's not business and not economy it's a half-way house. In summary the good: seating ground staff priority check in and boarding the bad: inflight service food transfer gate distances.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX 879 SFO-HKG on 1/19/2014 in Business. This was a very poor business class service to HKG. The SFO lounge is a disgrace no First section a $12 bottle of champagne served and even that was not chilled and hence not available as they had received the shipment only in the morning. Seat 22A is in the 2nd small section of the business class cabin (3 class - no First on this service) and it is not at all private or inviting (and the crew made no attempts to make anyone feel welcome) main boarding is from this cabin so very rushed and feels like an extension of premium economy rather than a premium cabin (on a 5 star airline). No introduction or goodbye from the cabin service director (even on AA they do that) no welcome drink offered no news papers or magazines (sorry none loaded sir). Constant loud noise from the galley and the 2 main closets being opened and closed in this business section. Meal service very mediocre. Wines on the Chilean Promotion not loaded no other alternative. 2 Wines to choose from and the champagne was served across the entire cabin from one bottle (had to wait for it to be transferred back and forth and it was not chilled). Lights dimmed after 3 hrs only to be jarringly switched on full throttle 6 hrs into the flight while one is sleeping for dinner service. We had 8 more hrs to go why does pre-arrival dinner need to be served when all we are trying to do is sleep? Average food and not appetizing in presentation. Crew did dim the lights as I wanted to sleep but in general were not bothered one of the lav doors was always wide open and let out bright lights in the cabin and I stood up to close the door 4 times and the crew did nothing. No coffee water etc offered prior to arrival as galley was closed (1.5 hrs out of HK?). Even the new business class seat layout seems cramped even AA have better spacing (on the exact same seats on their 777-ER) and that is saying something. I'm sorry Cathay you missed the mark completely - both hard and soft product on this service. Yes they have good HK lounges but on board this product miserably failed to deliver. Maybe my expectations are that of Qatar business and this CX business is way way sub par.,0,4,D Thakkar,2015-02-18,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,2,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Our second experience flying with Cathay Pacific. Flew Manchester to Narita via Hong Kong and return in Business (January 2015). The service food and seat were all excellent on outbound and inbound legs on the 777-300 apart from the Hong Kong to Narita leg which was a regional configuration. I found the shell seat to be a little uncomfortable as I am 5ft 3in and could not get the leg rest to a comfortable angle with my legs and feet left dangling. Cathay uses a third party lounge at Manchester Terminal 2 which was small but adequate for a light breakfast. A member of Cathay ground staff escorted us all from the lounge to the boarding gate and we were boarded before the other passengers. A short transfer at HKG but the Wing lounge was very crowded. The First Class lounge was being upgraded so First passengers were allocated half of the Wing business section. It was almost impossible to find a seat. The return leg we found the Cathay lounge at Narita quite disappointing so used the JAL lounge instead which had a better selection of food and more comfortable seating. Boarding was a shambles however as we were called to the gate early. The flight was not yet open for boarding and the gate area was not big enough to accommodate everyone. Although there was a separate First/Business boarding lane this was so clogged with Economy passengers the staff gave up and just let everyone through regardless. However once on board the service was excellent and luckily the 777-300 had the long haul flat-bed seats. Transit through HKG was swift and we decided to use the Bridge lounge which was not very crowded and had a very good selection of food and drinks. We had time for a shower and relax before the HKG-MAN flight at 01.00 am. Unfortunately when we got to the gate for boarding the plane had not been towed onto stand so we had to stand around for about 45 minutes before boarding started. Here though once started the boarding was much more organised and the First/Business passengers were boarded first with less of a scrum to get on board. The flight was very bumpy which meant we did not get as much sleep as we had hoped but we arrived on time even though we had departed late. Manchester airport immigration was empty at 6.20 am so we got through and collected our luggage in about 15 minutes. Apart from the chaotic boarding at Narita and the poor lounge we would certainly choose to fly CX again.,0,8,J Cooper,2015-02-11,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew JFK to Hong Kong round trip on B777. Avoid economy class. Seats are very uncomfortable. There is simply not enough leg room in economy and this is made first by reclining seat crushing one's knees.

Boarding was a shambles however as we were called to the gate early. The flight was not yet open for boarding and the gate area was not big enough to accommodate everyone. Although there was a separate First/Business boarding lane this was so clogged with Economy passengers the staff gave up and just let everyone through regardless. However once on board the service was excellent and luckily the 777-300 had the long haul flat-bed seats. Transit through HKG was swift and we decided to use the Bridge lounge which was not very crowded and had a very good selection of food and drinks. We had time for a shower and relax before the HKG-MAN flight at 01.00 am. Unfortunately when we got to the gate for boarding the plane had not been towed onto stand so we had to stand around for about 45 minutes before boarding started. Here though once started the boarding was much more organised and the First/Business passengers were boarded first with less of a scrum to get on board. The flight was very bumpy which meant we did not get as much sleep as we had hoped but we arrived on time even though we had departed late. Manchester airport immigration was empty at 6.20 am so we got through and collected our luggage in about 15 minutes. Apart from the chaotic boarding at Narita and the poor lounge we would certainly choose to fly CX again.,0,8,J Cooper,2015-02-11,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew JFK to Hong Kong round trip on B777. Avoid economy class. Seats are very uncomfortable. There is simply not enough leg room in economy and this is made first by reclining seat crushing one's knees. I had to stand up in the back gallery for almost 8 hours out of the almost 16 hours to bear the flight. Drinks mainly consisted of warm water. Lucked out on the way back and had a whole row of sits to stretch out on.,0,1,R Mossadegh,2015-02-11,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,3,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,5th Jan CX256 15 Jan CX110 and CX161. What a disappointment all the flights were. Heathrow/Sydney/Hong Kong/Heathrow. The most uncomfortable flight I have been on facilities virtually non-existent I am diabetic and when I asked for a biscuit was told I should have taken my own food the staff continually imposed their routines upon passengers lights out windows shut. The toilets smelt very bad at the end of the flight. The food was very poor and when one of my friends asked for a bread roll they claimed that they did not have any and what they did have were for the breakfast. One of our party cannot walk and is wheelchair bound at one point she had to wait 20 minutes for someone to respond to her request to be wheeled to the toilet. Two of us followed to assist and then had to stand in front of the toilet door for her privacy there was a complete lack of space - I would add that she is tall and very slim so size was not an issue. Very disappointing and far from being the best airline.,0,1,Sheila A Cowen,2015-02-11,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I flew from LHR to HKG and HKG to Cebu on 20/12/2014. I have made CX my preferred airlines as they always make a fuss of me. Check in was fast and efficient lounge at London was comfortable and quite. I was very well looked after on both segments of my flights. Food excellent and service very good.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I flew from HKG-LAX on 01/27/2015. I had flown CX before and was looking forward to the experience. The First Class Lounge was as usual excellent. I had a light breakfast in the dining room so as not to spoil my appetite for the meals on board. The 777-300ER was updated with the new First Suite fabric and seat/lighting controls. The Flight Service manager was wonderful as were the other two Flight Attendants in the cabin. As it was my birthday the crew surprised me prior to landing with a birthday card. The food was as expected - stellar and love the caviar course. Studio CX consistently delivers with plenty of entertainment and the bed is a favorite part of the experience with actual turndown service and so comfortable. The wardrobe/closet is a welcome touch to store shoes hang clothing and more. I have seen others post a comment that I truly agree with - I didn't want this flight to end as it is such a positive comfortable experience.,0,10,Jim Ash,2015-01-28,yes,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew AKL-HKG-LHR. We received priority boarding as a premium economy passenger which gave us time to settle in to our seat. The seat pitch is 38 inches which is the same as BA and Virgin with plenty of room. There were headrests and footrests which made the trip comfortable as well as an amenity kit. The food was amazing probably because it came straight out of business class. Overall the trip was better value for money than Air New Zealand Spaceseat although the entertainment wasn't up to date.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Return economy trip SYD-HKG-Frankfurt and back. Departure 8th Dec on CX100 then CX289 with short transfer layover at HKG. Return trip on 12th Jan with 14 hr layover HKG. All legs almost 100% capacity. Very satisfied with the service provided by this carrier overall. I would rate satisfaction level of Cathay at the top of recent travel experience - slightly above V Australia (who are also very good). Aircraft mix of Airbus and Boeing in very good to excellent condition. Inflight entertainment almost as good as Emirates (no complaints) flight crew including pilots excellent level of attention throughout flight very good. Amenities cleanliness well maintained. Meals were about on par with most carriers - satisfactory but not outstanding. Preferred the configuration of the Boeing 777 - 3x3x3 to the A330 2x4x2. Ground experience at all airports excellent and efficient. Seating - special mention - the seats offer quite reasonable legroom and recline in economy. However found the seat base to be too thin resulting in discomfort after a few hours. Would be appreciated if this could be improved - otherwise satisfactory. Found seating comfort similar to V Aust who also operate 777 configuration and probably best long haul economy seat experienced. Inflight issue with entertainment unit rectified by cabin crew. Additional security measures at HKG resulted in minor delay to scheduled departure - additional safety measures/precautions - no complaints or issue. Suggest Cathay consider - the provision of basic passenger pack - toothbrush/paste/earplugs/eye shades - increase to luggage allowance. Excellent value for money with this trip in comparison to other similar carriers - delivered with a higher level of customer satisfaction. Would use and recommend again.,0,8,Cooper Stephen,2015-01-19,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,My return trip from JFK to Bangkok via Hong Kong was one of the best flying experiences I have had. The new flat bed seats are comfortable to sit in and to lie down in and easy to function the choice of wines is limited but top drawer and the flight crew on all four sectors were neither slack or over the top. On these long flights it is always important to arrive at both ends in a relaxed frame of mind and I really think that Cathay have got their business class in great order and I will be using them whenever I can.,0,10,R Turnley,2015-01-19,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,9 Dec returning on 12 Jan. Flights CX358 and CX901 outbound and CX934 and CX357 on return journey. Myself and a friend decided to fly with Cathay given then good reviews we have read but unfortunately we were not impressed by the level of service we received. We flew return from Manchester to Hong Kong which is about 12-13 hours duration. Our outward journey was the better of the two legs no delay and the service was okay. I asked for a chicken dinner which was then forgotten and then I was given the only available option which I couldn't eat. On the journey back me and my friend were separated by 9 rows and both given a middle seat. After being sent to three different Cathay staff they were unable to change our seats. To top it all off the flight home was delayed. The quality of service doesn't warrant the premium you pay for travelling with Cathay other airlines are a better bet in my opinion.,0,8,Kyle Hipperson,2015-01-19,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,2,N/A,2,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Traveled business class between Bangkok and Colombo twice in last month principally because it is the cheaper than Thai or MAS. Terrible departure times 23.05 from Bangkok and even worse 02.25 from Colombo. Cathay now flies A330 instead of Boeing 777 which I think was better. Seat in capsule format very uncomfortable with recline minimal. In fully reclined position can't fully extend your legs. Three hour flight was just about tolerable. I wouldn't go for anything longer. Service on board is in a hurry to get things over as quickly as possible. Wine bought to you seat in a glass rather than bottle. Not impressed: Meals pretty mediocre. Cathay used to be amongst the best but all these airlines are being eclipsed by the Middle East carriers.,0,5,Andrew Bratt,2015-01-19,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,2,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Travelled SYD-HKG-CDG-HKG-SYD. SYD-HKG operated by A333 all other flights operated by 77W. Seat comfort was very good even for such a long flight with adequate back support and leg room.I found it relatively easy to sleep on Cathay. Food was of a very high quality for an airline - especially the Asian food options. The IFE system Studio CX kept me entertained for the entirety of my flights. The highlight was when I was flying from HKG-SYD and was stuck in a row of crying toddlers. The flight attendant came and asked whether I would like to move seat without me even asking. I was moved to a free exit row seat. It's the kind of service that you would not get out of the vast majority of competitors.,0,10,B Williams,2015-01-19,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Have been flying this airline almost on an annual basis in economy from LHR via HKG to MNL over the last seven years and have seen it deteriorate. The new economy seats might be an improvement over the old clam shell seats but leg space is minimal and being 6'2"" I have major problems without the passenger in front even reclining. I find it quite odd that the regionally configured older 777s and 747s offer substantially more legspace than the newer aircraft used on the London route. The cabins are kept at a freezing temperature as standard and there is no respite for my feet as they no longer provide socks. Meals are pretty poor and they don't serve water from a bottle but use tap water that tastes bleachy. CX really appears to have given up on the HKG to MNL route and offer a service akin to a budget airline. Very chaotic boarding dismal catering and no full drinks service are offered on this route.",0,6,Nick Roberts,2015-01-14,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,3,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew from Melbourne to London Heathrow on 7 Jan 15. Cathay experience was very good indeed. On the leg Melbourne to Hong Kong was in Premium Economy and this was well worth the extra cost. The leg room was very good as was the food and the cabin staff. From Hong Kong to London Heathrow was upgraded to Business Class and all I can say is wow. The level of comfort and food was excellent the cabin crew could not do more for you.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,LHR-HKG-BNE in Business Class. Cathay Pacific never fail to impress in many aspects of their Business Class product - from check-in to luggage collection it is an excellent product. Heathrow lounge continues to underwhelm and not up to quality of their HKG equivalents however the food and beverage selection were good. LHR-HKG on a spacious 773 and managed to secure the best seat in Business House (11A) which is situated in the first row of the mini-cabin behind First - meaning that I was wined dined and cleared in good time. Lunch starter desert and wines were superb but 'Signature' main course was disappointing service approached 9/10. I prefer the smaller and quieter Cabin lounge at Hong Kong and grabbed a shower and some tasty dim sum prior to the next leg. HKG-BNE flight was simply excellent on the A333. Despite the seat feeling a tad less spacious than on the 773 I managed 5 solid hours of sleep and was treated like royalty by the crew. I was referred to by name at every touch-point and the team provided an excellent dining experience that balanced efficiency anticipation and warmth in equal measure. My only minor gripe was that the main course was served cold however it was swiftly dealt with by the Purser who apologised profusely for the oversight. Cathay Pacific really do value your custom and it is little coincidence that they remain as 'one of the very best in the Business'.,0,9,Paul Budd,2015-01-11,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I flew with Cathay Pacific economy class from Amsterdam to Hong Kong and vice versa. It was (at a supplement) possible to reserve a seat next to the emergency exit. This gave me an enormous amount of space for my legs - very comfortable. However it was freezing!

You are just served with drinks and a sandwich which is so stingy of CX unlike PAL which still offers meals onboard.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Travelling from Singapore to New York. Both legs (SIN to HKG HKG to JFK) of the flight were perfect. Meals were better than many other airlines and they served good dim sum! Staff were attentive and friendly. I read some reviews complaining that once meals are served and lights are off Cathy crew tend to chat at the rest area. I certainly didn't witness this. My only complain is the lounge at Changi and HKIA. The lounges were far too crowded I couldn't get a seat at The Wing I wished for a shower but I was told that it comes with a 30 minutes wait. I ended up at the public food court for some decent Hong Kong food. Though I managed to rest at G16 during the 3 hours transit. And take note priority boarding almost doesn't exist for Cathay in HKIA. There was an announcement but not exercised by the ground crew. So if you are those who like to board early join the queue early!

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,LHR-HKG-SYD in December 2014. Flight was delayed and departed LHR nearly an hour late. No problem - relaxed in the business class lounge until flight was called. Boarding process went smoothly. Food during flights was excellent service as always superb. No time to check out lounges in Hong Kong as onward flight was boarding by the time I reached the gate. The only thing I think that lets the airline down is the in-flight entertainment which is a bit limited but it's a very minor issue.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I have had the opportunity to compare several carriers from SYD to FRA and DUS in Economy over the past few years and have just returned with CX from Europe for the first time. The words that come to mind are 'budget' and 'inconsistent service standards'. HKG to FRA return was a vastly different experience from SYD to HKG. On the way to Europe I reserved low fat meals and to say the food amounts were tiny (I am not big nor am I a huge fan of stuffing myself on planes) and certain elements of the meal service were non-existent compared to the regular fare would be an understatement. It was so mediocre that I decided to get the normal food offerings on the way back. One of the meal offerings from HKG to SYD which was a Beef Consume and can only be described as pieces of beef thrown into a clear flavourless broth with white rice was inedible. I am not the fussy however some things I noticed is that there were no hot towels only in premium economy CX are one of the few airlines who only allow 20kgs of checked baggage whereas all competitors TG/SQ/EK/BA allow more and the in season fruit salad consisted of about a handful of tiny pieces of Apple/Rock and Water Melon and soft drinks are poured out of bottles instead of receiving small cans. Apart from the fact that staff on the planes virtually never smile whilst serving passengers at least that was consistent. Furthermore 2 main meals were served within 3 hours of one another on a 9.5 hour flight back to Sydney. Why? When questioned I was told it was company policy. This resulted in not having any food for the last 5 hours to Sydney. Unlike SQ I also didn't notice on board staff helping or caring much about mothers with their young babies either. Now the good bits: Staff are very quick efficient and were always around throughout the flights with drinks and baskets of good snacks throughout FRA-HKG return not so much during SYD-HKG. Ice cream for dessert on two sectors was most welcome. The seats are very comfortable pitch is better than on paper leg room is very good each seat has a USB charger and the entertainment system is one of the easiest most enjoyable I have used although the movie /tv selection was not as vast as on some other carriers. Ground staff at all airports were also most helpful friendly and efficient. Had to unexpectedly break my trip in HKG and ground staff went out of their way to help me.,0,7,A Moreitz,2014-12-31,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,3,N/A,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,A330 Business MEL-HKG. Once onboard I found Cathay Pacific business class absolutely faultless. The seat was comfortable and well designed the crew were attentive friendly and professional the catering was delicious and the entertainment was of good quality and fairly good choice. I can completely see why this product receives such rave reviews from most passengers. My only real complaint is the ridiculously limited baggage allowance. 30kg total is barely acceptable on economy class but for business is it a disgrace. When you compare it to 32kg x3 for other carriers it is not very competitive.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX 701 & 702 (HKG-BKK-HKG). The flights were smooth the services were quite standard; nothing particular worth mentioning.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I flew economy from Brisbane to London via Hong Kong. The first leg Brisbane to Hong Kong was very busy and I took the view that the cabin crew were very pressed. Hence they made mistakes. For example I asked for red wine and got white wine despite the stewardess repeating my order to me. Water was served from plastic jugs and tasted of cleaning fluid. Clearly they had not been rinsed properly. And unlike most other airlines on such long haul routes there was no overnight pack (containing eg. toothpaste and toothbrush etc).

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"FRA-HKG-PVG return in October. Although Cathay's fares are rather expensive I choose this airline because of the stopover opportunity at Hong Kong and the perfect departure times. Most flights to Europe leave at midnight so you can spend the whole day in HKG. Long haul flights very good with great staff. Although FAs are a bit reserved in general they are very attentive polite and caring about passengers. Several drinks were offered during the night and you can get free snacks in the galley. Toilets were kept clean. Quality of the meals very good but poor quantity. Why doesn't CX offer salt and pepper anymore? Looks like a rather silly cost cutting. A very positive aspect is that seating is not too cramped there are ""only"" 9 seats in a row in Economy Class instead of 10. Cathay's IFE is good with a wide selection of movies but most of them only in English a little down. Transfer at HKG is very easy but takes some time at security check (about 20 minutes). On flights to Shanghai hot meals and AVOD entertainment were offered which is outstanding for a flight time of 2 hours!

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew Business class Doha - Hong Kong Round-trip. Both flights departed on time cabin crew were attentive and friendly. My Muslim meal request was honoured. However I opted for a window seat to look outside the cabin. Unfortunately it seems that CX has a policy of keeping window shades closed throughout the whole flight hence eliminating the purpose of window seat and the enjoyment of flying. I do not recommend flying with this airline if you enjoy window seat. I am a business class passenger and I expected to be treated with respect.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Business Class LHR-HKG B777. HKG-AKL A340. I believe the people are the one who define an airline. You can have the most luxurious seats in town but it means nothing if there is no real service on board. This is why I regard Cathay Pacific as the best airline in the business (we flew with SQ EK as well). We flew in both newish business class in B777 and the old 'coffin' style A340 business class cabin. I can understand why people complain about the old one but I didn't have a problem with that. It's still comfortable. The service from the people on board was superb. We had a problem during the flight to Auckland. My phone fell into the space behind the seat. The FA chief asked me to move to the empty seat next to my seat as it would probably not safe due to risk of spark from the friction between the phone and the seat. She asked my partner's number so she would update us once the engineer retrieved the phone. At the end they managed to retrieve the phone and the lady sent us a text about it and also wished us a great holiday in NZ. I'd never thought that we would get such a great service from an airline. We currently live in Europe so we flew frequently with European airlines. I have to admit that we really have low expectation on airline service. We paid premium for the ticket but it was great value for the money. The service was amazing throughout the journey. I must say the food on board and in the lounges were fantastic. So would I recommend this airline? absolutely. It's not the cheapest but you will get what you paid for.,0,10,Carlos Blanco,2014-12-18,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Recently had to make an emergency booking and the prices were very high no business class seats were available so flew on Premium Economy. Check in was very fast and efficient at Heathrow and being a Marco Polo member was able to access the lounges London and HK. Boarded very quickly and settle into my seat with no seats in front of me (I actually found it uncomfortable compare to having a seat in front). Champagne served before take off food was surprisingly good and as usual Cathay pacific stewardess were excellent. At HK I flew business class to Cebu. Check in at Cebu fast and efficient and onto HK in premium class never did like the lounge in Cebu lack of decent food. Quite surprise no champagne was offered perhaps it because it is regional flight. Food wasn't that appetising so didn't bother. Premium class from HK to London champagne and soon settle into my seat this time half way with seat in front and this time I had a superb air steward he really did look after me I wasn't feeling too good – many thanks for that. OK Good point about premium class it is worth it if you can book in advance as the prices are much more reasonable excellent cabin crews quieter cabin and great food on long haul flights. The bad point about premium class I don't think you get welcome champagne on regional flights and the food isn't good except on long haul flights divider curtains remain open for an hour before takeoff and landing and I didn't like the fact that economy class passengers were using our rest rooms facility. Plastic cups for soft drinks or wine is a big no for me it should have been in a glass.,0,10,S Howard,2014-12-10,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Booked through QR for a MAN-DOH-HKG return with DOH-HKG operated by CX. A330s on both flights. My first-time with CX as I usually use QR for the whole route. After having read some poor reviews on here I wasn't looking forward to these sectors especially as QR are my favourite airline. But what a surprise! Both sectors were fairly busy yet the cabin crew were faultless: friendly talkative helpful and completely professional - some of the best crews I've come across anywhere. Both flights arrived early. Both planes spotlessly clean. Bags on the belt at HKG soon after clearing immigration. Stress-free in-town check-in as always at Hong Kong Station. My only criticisms are: the seats are better suited to short-haul not the 9-10 hours needed for the DOH-HKG sector the food isn't Asian enough and they make everyone close the shades for most of the flight - but the latter is just a personal issue and I know some may prefer it this way. Overall the two flights with CX were better than the two flights with QR and I am now considering flying direct from MAN with CX for my next trip to Hong Kong.,0,10,Robert Szocik,2014-12-10,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,3,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I flew SYD-HKG-LHR in business class. I chose this airline because of the reviews and the full flat bed seats and I wasn't disappointed. I was concerned that the seat wouldn't be very comfortable when it converted into a bed but I slept surprisingly well. The flight crew in my cabin were attentive courteous and professional. I was always addressed by name and nothing was too much trouble for them. I arrived into London feeling rested and refreshed. The only criticisms (and they are minor) were the meals on the SYD-HKG leg which were only average (the food on the HKG-LHR leg was superb) and the in-flight entertainment which was a bit limited. I had plenty of other things to occupy me though so this wasn't much of a problem.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"LHR to Hong Kong and then onto Australia. The flight from LHR to Hong Kong was one of the worst I have experienced. During the flight it was very cold and several people were sitting with top coats on. I asked a flight attendant if the heating was working and the reply was ""it will warm up once we get going"". After 6 hours it was still freezing. It took ages for the food to be served and there seemed to be a lack of staff. If like me your over 6ft the seating is very tight. On our return from Australia there was no change. Sitting at the back it was a case of take it or go hungry as the food on the menu had run out. It was still cold and the paper thin blankets given out were a waste of time.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,LHR-HKG-SYD and return. Business Class at a good fare thanks to a recent sale. Used Cathay Pacific earlier in the year to get to Bali and having been somewhat underwhelmed I managed my expectations accordingly for this very long journey. All I can say is my expectations didn't need to be managed! Of the four flights one was 'outstanding' (SYD-HKG) two were 'very good' (LHR-HKG and HKG-LHR) and one was 'no worse than BA' (my benchmark for lacklustre Business Class service) (HKG-SYD). New clean planes on all sectors. On-demand entertainment with a wide choice. Flat beds. Very good to excellent food with the exception of the breakfast on the HKG-SYD leg which was very poor indeed. Lovely wines. And on time or very close to it. But it's the cabin crew who really make (or break) the flight and Cathay Pacific crew are in my view generally the best out there. Attentive but not pushy. Service with a smile. And apparently happy - at least in front of the paying customers.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,My partner and I flew premium economy in October 2014 from London to Perth. The leg from London to Hong Kong was ok with very attentive cabin crew. We were both very disappointed with the seat and limited space in premium economy. We found the food and beverage service very similar to economy class. The leg from Hong Kong to Perth was very disappointing as my inflight entertainment system was unavailable due to the TV screen being jammed. This was made worse as it had not been fixed for several days and the cabin crew were aware of it. I was given $75 American dollars to spend on boards as compensation. On my return to Perth I made a complaint to the airline regarding my experience. The airline did reply apologising for the unavailability of the inflight entertainment system. I was offered another $75 American to spend onboard my next Cathay Pacific flight. I was not happy with the response from Cathay and as a result will not choose to fly with them again. My partner and I were very disappointed with Premium Economy and did not feel it was worth the extra money really not much better than economy class.,0,1,Denise Higginson,2014-11-25,no,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,We flew economy Brisbane to Paris Via London and Hong Kong which although had 2 stops was faster than 1 stop and the departure and arrival time was suited - able to leave at night after work and arrive at night tired. We had great service and were ready to sing Cathay praises. This flight was great the meals movies etc. We chose Cathay as it had good prices and times for an open jaw flight bookable directly on their site (I prefer not to use Travel agents). Return was NYC to HK and HK to BNE. The meals were terrible. For a 14 hour trip and we were served 2 terrible meals (the first in many flights that I have ever really thought - yuk) and just couldn't eat including vegetables and pasta SO overcooked. (miss being able to pre-order seafood meals and no healthy options unless you want a fruit plate served at every meal for 60+ hours - really?). We were lucky that we got on with food and coffee from the airport lounge (as they take some time to serve - unlike Singapore) and the passenger next to us told us how grumpy he was due to hunger - after his 2 meals! When we buzzed cabin service on the return trip it was served with a grimace and we were made feel uncomfortable. It is very different from the excellent professional and immediate service that Singapore Airlines provides in economy.,0,6,L Bennies,2014-11-20,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,3,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"CX888 HKG to YVR. The HKG flight to JFK via YVR leaves at 1 am. So if you are on holiday and even if you leave your baggage at the hotel for the day it makes for a very long stay at the airport. The lounges are excellent (the Wing is very good the Bridge is excellent the Pier very dated-try to find e.g. a USB port) unlike American business lounges they have hot food some to order champagne and several staff cleaning and tidying the lounges. Our flight was delayed. The excuse was ""late towing."" I've never heard that excuse. Apparently the plane was there all along but ground staff had neglected to tow it to the gate. When it finally showed up they promised us a 1.50 a.m. departure. At 2.20 we were still on the tarmac. On the plus side the cabin crew were excellent they whipped into action once we were airborne and for those of us still wanting to eat they provided a great meal in no time. Drink service was a little tight; if you asked you got it and they were generous with pours but there was no e.g. pre-flight drink orders or refills without asking. The newish biz class seats are very comfortable and I really liked the storage areas. Their night masks have velcro. Sounds petty but a comfortable night mask really helps you sleep on a long haul. Their large AV screens offer a great range of movies and TV shows. The second meal was decent but no alcohol on offer (even though you arrive at YVR at 8:30 p.m. if on time). I would fly Cathay again in a heartbeat and think their air crew did a standout job but there is still room for some polish on service.",0,8,G Cassie,2014-11-20,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"NRT to HKG. Even though this is an international flight Cathay uses their ""regional"" 777 craft with the 2x3x2 config in business. My partner and I had the middle three the middle seat empty which is common on e.g. Lufthansa within Europe. Service was excellent. Food was very good. Flight was on time pleasant no issues. The NRT business lounge is nothing to write home about very basic needs an update. The regional biz seats do not fully recline. In fact if you're six feet (or taller) you will find in the recline position they are actually a little uncomfortable. I found it impossible to doze off even though with the early departure I was tired and ready for a snooze as you're lying in a sort of zig-zag pattern. Still the cabin seemed brand spanking new everything was in perfect order and there was much more leg room than a regional biz class flight in the US or Europe.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,ORD-HKG Oct 10. First Class on Cathay commands a premium but in the end you get little more than a bigger seat. Consistency and orientation seem to be big problems. For example they seem to offer some F passengers an escort through security while others (like me) do not get one. They offered a padded mattress (duvet) to some passengers but not to me. For the most part I was ignored. The Inflight Service Manager introduced herself at the beginning of the flight then disappeared for the remainder of the flight. The cabin crew delivers the meal then hides in the galley. They ran out of Heineken beer about 2 hours into a 16 hour flight. Don't get me wrong… the flight is not awful. The seat really is big. They serve 1 can of caviar Krug champagne Johnny Walker Blue and so on but how much of that do you really consume? But it is a HUGE premium and from my limited experience the Business Class is a better value assuming you can get accustomed to the Cathay service. They are really very friendly but they basically ignore you.,0,5,M Reno,2014-11-11,yes,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX903 MNL-HKG and CX904 HKG-MNL. Main gripe is they don't serve proper hot meals. Not even coffee. Even Philippine Airlines serves hot meals on the way to HKG. Early morning flight outbound. Online check in meant shorter queue and a chance for breakfast in the airport (which is essential since CX starves its passengers on this leg). I think breakfast should at least have been served. Seats on the older 777-200 was wide and comfortable but IFE non existent. Flight crew attentive and friendly. Mid-afternoon return flight on 777-200 with new configuration. More IFE options but food service basically non existent. Not even ice for the water was provided! My wife's monitor conked out 30 minutes after StudioCX was turned on and couldn't be addressed by the apologetic staff. I think CX should improve its regional service.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,My wife and I travelled from Sydney to Hong Kong on 3 October 2014 in Premium Economy. Cathay Pacific had not cleaned its on-board toilets prior to leaving Sydney. Shortly after take off we used two separate toilets on the plane. Both toilets were filthy both had urine all over the floors and smelt. Our second leg of our trip from Hong Kong to Paris with Cathay Pacific had a delayed departure of about 1 1/4 hours. Finally we discovered why there had been a delay. Cathay Pacific announced that the entertainment system on the plane was not working or more correctly that there was no power to the entertainment system. Hence in Premium Economy we spent 12 hrs on a plane with no entertainment system no reading light and an inoperative flight attendant call button due to no power. The responsiveness of the flight attendants remained minimalist despite the inability of passengers to call attendants. Overall Cathay Pacific's service and value we received for the money we had paid was very poor.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"We flew from Hong Kong to London Heathrow on 23 October. The flight left 35 minutes late. The first problem was that Cathay Pacific had not registered my vegetarian meal and were in the process of allocating this to a surprised passenger nearby (who was willing to accept it). When we let them know that it was me that had ordered the vegetarian option the crew said that It ""shouldn't be a problem - there was probably a spare vegetarian meal aboard"". Not what you want to hear at the start of a 13 hour flight. For the record the other partners on the flights involved (Virgin Atlantic and Air New Zealand) had registered my request and made it clear within minutes of our arrival onboard that they knew where to deliver the vegetarian meal. We saw the cabin crew for the two meals and on three occasions after - the other aisle was serviced our aisle had little assistance. I was awake for about two thirds of the flight so I didn't miss them while I was asleep. We had to almost grab a steward to hand over our rubbish.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I first flew Cathay in 2011 to China which was a very good experience in all areas (service catering entertainment etc) however I flew Cathay again in 2014 to USA and Canada and was very shocked at how the quality of their service catering and entertainment had declined in a matter of 3 years. The staff who were previously helpful are now unfriendly lazy and unhelpful and the catering is atrocious. The food is poor quality and has little or no taste and rightly said by another reviewer they somehow no longer provide salt and pepper! I understand times are tough with certain airlines but you wouldn't expect them to skim on basic condiments. The entertainment system has limited options and sadly I think the overall passenger experience in economy has gone downhill.

Eating and drinking ""sumptuously"" while surrounded by passengers sipping cola and chewing on a morsel made me self-conscious and slightly uncomfortable. A flight attendant informed me that the others had been upgraded and had not paid the fare that I had and was thus not deserving of the full meal and drinks and convenience pack normally provided in this cabin!

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,YVR-HKG-MEL in Premium economy. On balance a bit of a mixed bag experience. Seats definitely an uptick from economy but the fundamental problem is cabin design which is flawed - the cabin feels like a retrofitted afterthought which it is. On the B777 YVR-HKG leg the one toilet in premium economy is in the right front of the cabin necessitating anyone on the left side of the plane to crawl across the four seats in the middle front row to access it. That isn't well thought out and isn't a nice thing to do to the people sitting there and is difficult at night with all four people stretched out sleeping so the alternative is walking back into economy down the left aisle which is a hassle. On the A330 HKG-MEL there is no premium economy toilet which requires a trip back to economy. Food seemed more 'economy' than 'business' but to be expected really. The other big negative on the YVR-HKG flight was the premium economy cabin was filled with upgraded passengers due to a massively oversold economy cabin. I would estimate 80% of the people in premium economy were upgraded and not for status reasons which makes the logic behind paying for it hard to justify. On the positive side Cathay service always shines and the crews are professional and efficient.,0,5,J Rose,2014-10-28,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,4,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,MEL-HKG-YYZ return in economy. It was okay let's face it economy is never going to be fantastic but for economy it was just fine and I would do it again. As we were going to Canada we were allowed 23kg x 2 which is great. I considered upgrading to Premium Economy but it would have been an EXTRA $4000 for the two of us just too much. The flight to and from HKG from Mel was fine. Seat a little hard but we found sitting on their blanket in its bag helped there. The food was okay. The FA's were lovely very friendly. Entertainment very good also. Flight to Toronto was full. We paid extra for exit row seats. Was very cold against the door. I had wrapped just about everything I could around my legs it was really freezing there but still not a bad seat in that you could just walk straight out of it no climbing over anyone so if you go for that seat bring warm items for your legs. Going to YYZ was better than returning. Returning the staff seemed to disappear. They were not very organised at YYZ coming back either the line ups were all messed up and wheelchairs couldn't get through. They called the far rows first before business and it was just a big crazy mess of confused people. We were late leaving HKG for MEL due to late passengers but not surprising as there was a gate change. Mostly though the flights were on time our luggage arrived safely the entertainment was good and thank goodness there were no shell seats as what we experienced back in March. After travelling to Canada before via LA this is a far better option even if longer.

I have never ever experienced such poor service in all my years of flying the staff on this flight had no recollection of customer service or relations to earn the 2014 airline of the year baffles me. we will certainly not be using Cathay on future flights the aviation world is full of options.,0,1,Stephensen Warren,2014-10-28,no,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Traveling with Cathay Pacific in premium economy class from Doha to Hong Kong in 28 August 2014. Flight was on time and was operated on a A330-300. Welcome drinks and hot towel was served when I got on the plane. Touch screen entertainment system was sensitive and films were up to date. Dinner was served 1.5 hours later and it was good. However breakfast wasn't good - just a snack box served with a very cold chicken wrap - Qatar Airways serves a hot meal on the same route in economy class. Crew should smile more. Seat was uncomfortable and after a eight hours flight I was very painful. The toilet was dirty. Flight arrived Hong Kong on time. I won't pay about a double price than economy class next time when I travel in Cathay's premium economy class.,0,7,James Ng,2014-10-13,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,4,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Shanghai Pudong-Hong Kong-Newark on Sep 25 Chicago ORD-Hong Kong-Shanghai Pudong on Oct 5 very disappointing experience! Shanghai-Pudong-Hong Kong on Dragonair's A330 entertainment system breakdown for whole aircraft during the entire journey very simple lunch served (only rice or pasta with a mini-size salad) when arrived at HKG bussed to terminal which is really inconvenient. HKG-EWR a disaster again after simple dinner served (tiny rice or pasta with tiny salad nothing else) no real food (except chips) could be provided until the breakfast (very funny arrangement as we landed EWR at 21.00pm New York time after almost 16hrs flight). Return flight ORD- HKG was the same for such one of the world's longest flight CX really doesn't care about passengers in the economy cabin. Entertainment was good for HKG-EWR and ORD-HKG staff friendly except the HKG-PVG sector.,0,3,Steven Cao,2014-10-12,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,3,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew Premium economy ADL to HK with connecting flight to LHR on 27 August. Flight left Adelaide 90 mins late so missed flight to LHR. What followed was the most frustrating of experiences. 10 hours in HK then we were forced to fly via Tokyo to LHR. Delay of another 7 hours in Tokyo. Arrived LHR feeling dreadful. No compensation whatsoever was offered to us until our daughter complained and we were offered a $100 voucher each which we still have not received and we are now back in Adelaide. Then came the return flight last week. Plane out of LHR delayed two hours. Turned up at airport with bags packed (as we had been told to do whilst still at home) only to be advised that they could not get us on a flight out of HK for 48 hours. Back home and unpacked bags. Two days later had to fly home via Melbourne as no seats available on direct Adelaide flight.,0,1,S Tchan,2014-10-12,no,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Probably the best of the legacy carriers. Had a trip DCA-HKG-LHR in economy and there was little to fault from price food seats and service.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flight 293 from Hong Kong to Rome on an A340-300 seat 16A. As it was a late night flight was told that my meal would be available when requested. When I asked they said they were unable to serve reheated food but would serve me their bowl of snack noodles which was just that. The AVOD was not functioning on arrival and continued to be out of order for the 11 hour flight. A most apologetic flight manager offered me some inflight shopping vouchers.

They carefully asked passengers' preference and when I was not sure which wine to order the flight attendant suggested me to try a little bit of each before making a decision. Very thoughtful indeed! I also enjoyed the conversation with them. The flight was slightly delayed but it didn't bother me too much. However the return flight CX549 was less impressive. The flight attendants were not as friendly and attentive as the outbound flight. They forgot and skipped my dessert.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"JFK-BKK return in F. Simply the best. Outbound via stopover in YVR on 773 seat was malfunctioning but staff were more than proactive in having engineering fix it the second we landed in Vancouver. Fantastic food drink and AVOD combined with immaculately professional service from FAs equals the absolute best way to fly commercially these days. Staff go above and beyond to ensure a 15+ hour flight feels as comfortable as possible. Lie-flat seat with comfy duvet and mattress pad mean I was able to get over 8 hours of solid sleep - a rare feat for my over 6-foot- tall frame. Flagship lounge ""The Wing"" in HKG very comfortable but could use some more food options. Otherwise impeccable.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I recently flew economy class from round-trip from the U.S. to Hong Kong on to Japan. I must report that the experience with Cathay Pacific was once again excellent. I enjoyed everything about the flight - the entertainment the flight crew the food and snacks. On this trip my bags were lost in the U.S. by American Airlines and did not make the transfer to Japan. However Cathay staff took responsibility provided me with compensation for my troubles and then delivered the bags the next day exactly when they said they would. I was extremely impressed with how they handled the situation (being very apologetic) to the professional manner in which they handled the situation.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"I took CX369 today from Pudong Shanghai airport. I was actually booked an earlier flight of KA891 which was cancelled due to typhoon ""Phoenix"" at 1830h I was being notified by CX via text message before 9am so at least I had enough time to rearrange another flight. It was all fixed before 10am - how efficient. When I arrived at the airport all flights were further delayed - ground staff gave me the option to change to another flight. Eventually the flight was 3.5 hours delayed and on landing in HGK it was only 2.5 hours delayed.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,SIN-HKG (A330-300) and HKG-SIN (B747-400). Very comfortable and reasonable services provided. Less interference by the staff and very prompt service. In-flight entertainment was adequate for the four hours flights. No qualms over the seats as there were adequate leg space for both flights except that it's not rolled back but protruding in front. Cathay Pacific certainly beat Singapore Airlines when it comes to value for money. But if you are talking about overall comfort and satisfaction I will still prefer SQ over to CX. However I will definitely fly with CX again if there is any good fares offered by them.,0,9,Wilson See,2014-09-28,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Had high expectations. My main gripe is the inflight entertainment. It is controlled by them and you cannot watch anything until about 15 mins after departure and then they took our headphones and turned the screen off when there was still 15 mins to go before landing! No other airline does this that I have flown with. You can watch what you like until 20 mins after landing with British Airways for example and many others. I had 7 mins left of the movie so not impressed. Food portion was small and not particularly nice. Wine is poured by them into a cup so you don't get much. Offered only twice on long flight. Other airlines give you a small bottle each time. Seats uncomfortable No toothpaste or toothbrush offered. Coffee revolting. Won't fly again with CP if I can avoid it.,0,4,L Loveridge,2014-09-22,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,4,2,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,LHR-HKG. Premium Economy cabin isolated from the mayhem of Economy and had its own toilet for PE passengers which was not crashed by Economy people. Service very good particularly the hostess who put my jacket away in a closet and remembered to return it to me as we stopped at the stand in HKG. Food a bit disappointing - the breakfast tasted poor and was sickly. Good choice of entertainment. Could not sleep in the seat though just not comfortable enough to relax sufficiently. On return journey cabin was partly empty which looked promising but the only benefit was faster service and no toilet queue. A man sat in front of me and reclined his seat fully for the whole 13 hours except meals which wrecked my journey. On a daytime East-West flight that is totally unacceptable and should not be permitted. I had to watch movies with the screen 30 cm from my face. It's the luck of the draw however and overall I would recommend the airline and cabin.,0,7,R Knight,2014-09-19,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Numerous flights with Cathay Pacific over the recent month or so almost all long-haul. Most recent was BNE-HKG- LHR-HKG-BNE. All flights packed but on-board service remained good. However even for an Emerald Frequent Flyer (and I fly Cathay so many times I've lost count) getting a window seat preference was not always possible. Also while the cabin crew always seemed to do their best the same cannot be said for their lounge counter staff especially in the Hong Kong (First Class) Lounge who only rarely seem ready or willing to assist with enquiries.

That was disappointing as no mention to reason for delays until we finally go aboard! Ground staff service could be better. Inflight service was reasonably good but I miss the gourmet coffees on SQ!

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,FRA to HKG return plus a PVG-HKG sector in between (in Ordinary Econ). All flights on 777-300ER. Each on time arrivals. Find the PE seats a definite notch up from the Econ ones as you would expect. The front row middle section is nice because of the extra legroom but I found the leg rest fiddly and not terribly comfortable. Also as others have noted the S/B side toilet means a lot of people have to clamber past you to use it which gets tiresome. Food and drink tasty and plentiful surprisingly for a HK based carrier the western option was better than the Chinese one ! There seems to be a running debate on here as to whether PE is worth the difference over Econ. I'd say it all depends on the extra fare demanded. In my case it was about 30% more which to my mind is worth paying. I've seen some instances where it's nearly double the Econ fare which I'd not feel justified in paying. Overall CX's is better vfm than the BA or Virgin product but still well behind that of Air New Zealand.,0,8,John Fairclough,2014-09-17,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,3,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

I enjoyed my trip and was pleasantly surprised with the food this time more than any other.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Amsterdam to Bali with transit in Hong Kong. Did the same trip with SQ last year with transit in Singapore. I have to say that the SQ experience was much better. CX seats are awful for my back. SQ gave more attention and the service was not rushed. Cut backs are quite obvious with smaller food portions and only water during the night. The seafood congee breakfast had three small prawns and four slithers of mushrooms and that was it. Quite inadequate. The last few years I have flown many times to Hong Kong with Qantas BA and Qatar. CX do not stand out compared to other airlines.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flight CX162 from Sydney to Hong Kong on August 31. Unfortunately the touch screen in front of me had some problems midway through the trip and turned blank. Asked a cabin attendant for help but nothing could be done except resetting the inflight entertainment system which meant everyone on board would have to stop watching their movies for 10 mins. I was left with nothing to do for the 2nd half of my journey which was a bit of a let down as others were enjoying their movies.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I paid $2500 for a return flight Toronto - Bangkok on 22nd August 2014. The flights were on time. The food was mediocre. The entertainment was good. My real beef is with my return flight. The leg from Vancouver to Toronto was carried out by Westjet. 1) They (CX) could not issue my Wesjet boarding pass. I had to go to Westjet counter in Vancouver airport to get the boarding pass. 2) Since it was a red eye flight there was no sandwich provided even though I agreed to pay. This was a 4.5 hrs flight 3) You have to purchase a headphone. Headphones were provided free of charge on all CX flights. CX dropped the ball when they switched their passengers to Westjet.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX829 and CX723 YYZ to HKG and onto KUL on 24 Aug. In contrast to the outgoing flight I must say I was more than satisfied with my return flight. Early morning departure from Toronto we were the last flight to leave. Full flight boarding was organized and efficient and the ground staff were pleasant and accommodating. I had an empty seat next to me which helped. The meals were disappointing in terms of size but were tasty. Snacks were provided on the 15 hour flight to HKG but you had to ask. Good quality shortbread cookies and hot cup noodles were provided. Staff were pleasant and the cabin manager was very sweet. As I had a cold she made me a cup of tea with honey and lemon and checked on me later to ask if I wanted another one! Seats were ok not great and in flight entertainment was adequate. No real complaints. All flights were on time toilets were clean so all in all a slick operation.,0,8,R Gonzaga,2014-09-01,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I am a lifetime Gold Qantas member and just this week flew Sydney - Hong Kong Premium Economy with no issues flight food and service was great. Then boarded CX0364 to Shanghai flight was 30 minutes late boarding however then we waited in the plane for 3.5 hours before taking off (I watched 2 movies) the reason that there was 4 other flights ahead of us using the same route to Shanghai unbelievable. Then on the return flight to Hong Kong CX0369 arrived at the Pudong airport at 2.30pm for a 5.30pm flight to find all of the check in counters closed there was no real explanation for this but was told to check in at the standby counter. I did this and received a pass B16 it seems because I have gold status I was allocated to B the guy I was flying with being a silver was allocated C6 and the local guy a D as he has no status. In talking to other passengers we learnt that the 1.30 flight still had not left so it seems that the pass was a chance to get on an earlier flight. Now I could go on and on about this but the facts are that some of the Cathay staff were very rude and unprofessional in their handling of this matter we received no real info on what was going on except to ask us to come back at 4pm and then 6pm to check what was going on after returning at 5 mins to 6pm I heard my number B16 called so I was moved to the earlier flight which was supposed to depart at 7pm but finally left after 8pm then to rub salt into the wounds on arrival in HK we had to bus it to the terminal. I arrived at my hotel at 11.30pm but my boss arrived at 3.30am! I understand that flights are delayed from time to time however surely Cathay can train its staff to be polite and advise customers what is really going on.,0,1,Rod Oppy,2014-08-28,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,4,N/A,2,1,Cathay Pacific Airways

Service was impeccable as always quick service when I request anything entertainment is plentiful and staff were attentive even remembering my name and seat! Return back to LHR was a fully booked flight so service was a little slower but that was fine by me. Staff always had a smile on their face even though they were very busy.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX829 YYZ-HKG 24 Aug and connecting to CX723 to KUL. YYZ to HKG was a 15 hour flight in Premium Economy and was as perfect a flight as you could have wanted it to be! I was sick with a cold and the stewardess brought me a box of tissues and made me hot tea with lemon and honey. She enquired if I needed more and was quite attentive. When I told her I recognized her from my outbound flight on 4 Aug she was thrilled that I recognized her. Seats were spacious great leg room but I would have appreciated another 2 inches of recline to make sleeping that more comfortable. The downside was the food what was served was tasty but the portions were small and served on a tray not much larger than an A4 size piece of paper. The meal service was rushed and as it was a night flight there could have been more patrols with drinks and snacks. They need to improve on their snack quality which mainly consists of processed food. A few choices like fruit and sandwiches would have been nice. Would definitely fly with them again especially in PE.,0,9,R Gonzaga,2014-08-28,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Business Class ORD-HKG-ORD Seats 19A 19K. Could not get online boarding pass so had to go to the counter in Chicago. Unfortunately they only open a few hours before the flight leaves. So about 50 of us had to wait in line for over an hour before they open the counter. No choice can't even go to the bar to wait because you can't get into the terminal without a boarding pass. Poor selection of wine (hard to believe that the most popular wine in America - Chardonnay is not on flights to/from USA). Poorly stocked beverages every CPX flight I've been on has run out of various beers and soft drinks. Meal marginal. Overcooked beef. The service is bizarre. They are incredibly friendly and seem to be sincerely sorry as they apologize over and over throughout the flight for the various shortcomings. But having said that they are frustrating because they hide in the galley for most of the flight. Never come through the cabin. Seating on the plane is comfortable. Check-in at HKG is awful. They assume you are familiar with the process lounges etc. They offer no explanation or guidance. I fly the airline because the seats are comfortable and they have reasonable award levels for flights with Asia Miles/Marco Polo.,0,5,M Reno,2014-08-18,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,1,N/A,2,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

Considering it was less than two hours it is still acceptable though I have been on similar-length flights that served full meals (Air Macau MFM-TPE). Seats were unbelievably hard - I had aches upon arrival for both flights. Given the limited options between HKG and MNL guess this is already the best option.,0,7,Lau Ni,2014-08-18,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,3,N/A,4,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,London to HKG business. Upgraded from PE class so good start. Lounge nice quiet. Boarding chaotic due to families with teenagers choosing the ' small child board early ' call. Lovely onboard crew responsive and friendly. Food great TV excellent slept a lot.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"AMS to HKG Aug 3 and then HKG to SYD Aug 6. 6 ft passenger and 5 ft 6"" passenger Seats 32EG and then 31D E. On both flights the seats were superb - I can't sleep on flights but I felt very comfortable the whole time. Hindu Vegetarian food was excellent. On the 1st flight on the A340 there was only 1 toilet in Premium Economy and on the 2nd flight on the A330 there were no toilets - very annoying and not what you would expect when paying double or triple the economy price. Both flights were very late departing.",0,7,Kevin Forge,2014-08-13,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I flew Cathay Pacific on three sectors. Auckland - Hong Kong Hong Kong - London and Paris - Hong Kong. All flights were a wonderful experience particularly the two flights to and from Europe on the 777 - 300. Even the flight from Auckland on the ageing Airbus 340 was enjoyable. Comfortable seats good food and wine and friendly and professional staff. The airline certainly deserves its high rating and I would be happy to fly with them again.,0,9,Earl Geoffrey,2014-08-11,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,We have recently done an Evergreen Tour which was fantastic but we had to pay for our flights in October and pay for them. Come to the actual tour we could not book seats until 48 hrs before hand. So I stayed up until 11.55pm 48hrs before we flew and there were no seats left - how can that be! On the way home I checked in 48hrs and actual was able to get seats from San Francisco to Hong Kong and Hong Kong to Perth go to get our boarding pass and find out my husband and I aren't even together and yet when looking around behind us the middle four seats people had used them to sleep on because they weren't taken same goes for the two seats The air hostess didn't seem to even care or help us. After experiencing this because of the length of the flights I doubt very much that we will fly with Cathay again. Those hostesses couldn't get us fed quick enough. They left out on a bench nuts and a drink if we needed it.,0,2,Greg Karlovsky,2014-08-11,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,2,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew from Melbourne to HK then on to London. Back to HK from London. We have a 3 year old and found that only one of our flights was good for her. The staff didn't bother to give her the children's pack or smaller headphones although we were aware that they were available. When we asked for a snack for her they offered peanuts or mentoes hard sweets-both unsuitable for her. On the HK to London flight our attendant was great but all other flights we felt that we were being a nuisance if we asked for anything and even when they said they'd bring us something they didn't get around to it! This was simple requests like an orange juice or an extra bread roll. Our attendant from London to HK was very young and maybe just inexperienced. She was quite unfriendly. Personally I wish we had booked Singapore Airlines but the difference in price was significant. Two of our flights were delayed one by 90 minutes. Not ideal for connecting flights. They did allow our car seat on for free and it was bagged and handled carefully.,0,8,J Mason,2014-08-11,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,2,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX 506 HKG to KIX on a 25-year-old B747-400. Everything except the landing was very smooth despite bad weather at HKG. The shell seat was a bit cramped but was acceptable for a 3.5 hour flight. Cabin crew was fine although not outstanding. Flight meal was a bit below expectation. Incredible in-flight entertainment providing a wide selection of Western movies and local movies. Flight arrived 30 minutes late. CX 569 KIX to HKG on a new 0.7 year-old B777-300ER. Again flight crew and flight meal were not as good as expected for the best airline in the world otherwise very comfortable seats great management of the flight and again very impressive in-flight entertainment. Flight departed 10 minutes early and arrived more than 30 minutes early which was impressive. Overall I had a feeling that the good standard of Cathay Pacific's catering and cabin services is a bit inconsistent although they are generally stronger than other airlines.,0,8,Jeremy Chan,2014-08-06,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,3,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I generally found there was little value for my money when I flew from HKG to YVR besides the highly capable and friendly air hostess who came rather quickly once the call button was pressed. Credit goes to Cathay for their well-trained and attentive staff. The egg omelette was bland and cold which made it made it fairly unappetizing. The dinner was edible. They had one selection of wine for the six passengers in first class and a different selection of wine available to business class. This basically begs the obvious how much wine could six people drink in 12 hours. My main complaint with the window seats of their newly reconfigured business class is that one could not even look out of the window. It is utterly self-defeating to call these window seats. Unfortunately it doesn't help that their business class seats make one feel like one is lying in a coffin when one adjusts the seat to the flatbed position. As for their dysfunctional armrests I find myself sitting in a chair with my left arm higher than my right arm for 11 plus hours. I could rest my left arm comfortably when I am properly seated but I could not find the expected corresponding position for the right armrest. The selection of movies was forgettable for a long flight like HKG to YVR. The television shows available were equally lousy. Lastly the noodle bar closes at 23.00 hours at their business class lounge called the Pier. This meant anyone who had a flight after midnight had a very limited selection of refreshments at the business lounge. Altogether Cathay needs to either improve the quality of their food and entertainment or start cutting their business class fare.,0,3,C Hung,2014-08-06,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,4,1,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX790 KUL to HKG and CX826 to Toronto. Premium economy seats all the way. The seats are comfy and have great legroom but still feel cramped when the seat in front reclines. On the first leg KUL-HKG there was no drink service before takeoff or a hot towel in sight something Cathay hypes about in their commercials for premium economy. I was disappointed with the meal service as although we were served economy class meals the portions were tiny for a 14.5 hour flight. Staff were great pleasant and courteous and it was always service with a smile. They weren't around much after the meal service but did respond to calls. Personally I do not think these seats are great value for money due to the inadequate meal service and the general similar cramped feeling of economy. The seat mechanism was difficult to work and my seat would not go upright without the help of a steward who said that they were having problems with the premium economy seat recline mechanism.,0,7,R Gonzaga,2014-08-06,no,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,2,N/A,5,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,BKK-HKG on a busy Saturday afternoon in July on an ageing A330-300. The plane looked and felt old and the shell- type seats are not my favourites - but on a full flight they guaranteed a little more privacy and leg room. The flight was on time but otherwise very ordinary really and the staff had to run on this full flight to finish the meal service on time. Moreover the white wine they serve on their short flights is awful and always warm.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,SIN-HKG-SIN on CX650 and CX635 on 25/28 July 2014. Both flights had good on-time departure and arrived on time. For both flights were supposed to experience new CX Business Class seats but alas both flights had a last-minute swap of aircraft's. Not only we had to take regional business class seats twice CX also did not bother to allocate two pax in the same PNR to sit together. Food was okay - better than OZ Business but not as good as SQ Business. IFE and service was good - the earphones were more comfortable than SQ Business. Overall a good experience though I would have given 1 or 2 more stars if not for the equipment change.,0,7,Lau Ni,2014-08-02,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flights were really nice. Premium Economy seats were plush and service was excellent (on one leg - kind of standard on the outbound). Food was generally good but comparable to Economy. Given the similar price point I'd go with CX Y+ over SQ Y. For the regular traveler I'd go with CX Y+ anytime. Too bad the price point is HK$8000+. I'd choose CX Y if not on miles.,0,9,T Alvin,2014-08-02,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,22 July we flew Dragonair to connect with Cathay 0135 from Hong Kong to Melbourne. We missed our connection and began a 48 hour ordeal exacerbated by poor customer service a lost bag airline transfers that left us sandwiched between babies and high school kids on Thai Airways into Sydney with a seven hour wait before we boarded a flight into Adelaide. All together this was a horrible trip. Cathay has promised to be in touch but we're home four days and nothing. Let's face it - an airline is about what happens both in the air and on the ground.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"CX841 from New York JFK to HKG. Flight used a fairly new 777-300ER. There was priority boarding for first business premium economy then the passengers at the rear rows of the economy class cabin. Because of my seat being at the very rear of the cabin seat 67A I was able to board earlier than some. Cabin Crew were very friendly and responsive. The food was pretty good I had the fish option which consisted of Baked Salmon with black pepper sauce lima beans and carrots and spinach mashed potatoes. On the side was a warm bun with butter and a chicken salad. There was also a haagen-dazz ice cream for dessert. As this was a 16 hour flight we were offered a second meal in which I got the chicken with rice option that came with a peach yoghurt cake topped with honey toasted oatmeal a fruit salad and once again a warm bun with butter. The seats were fairly comfortable and I was very thankful not to be on a flight with the old fixed shell seats. The AVOD at my seat was horrible. It would not respond to my touch at all or would take more than 5 minutes. I alerted the cabin crew they told me that I had to take it slow. After showing them that it didn't work they went back to the galley apparently ""reset"" the AVOD and told me to try again. They ignored me after that. A tip for all you others out there traveling on long distance flights on the 777-300ERs. At the rear galley there is a snack tray or bin with peanuts chips and other goodies if you feel hungry between meals.",0,7,Chen Chevy,2014-07-29,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,3,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,PVG-SYD. Dragonair Business to HKG Cathay Premium Economy CX101 HKG-SYD. After many years of flying the Shanghai- Sydney route decided to try Cathay PE. While it was acceptable it is certainly nothing to get excited about. As with many other comments I agree it is slightly better than standard economy and far inferior to Business. While not being so interested in the food or entertainment both of which were fine I am much more interested in the comfort factor. Cathay PE does not meet my requirements. Both meal services dinner on departure and breakfast before arrival the empty food trays sat for far too long obviously the staff serve PE first then do the economy cabin service so it can be a long time before they return to collect the food tray. Cabin lights remained fully lit well into the 23:55 flight departure. They advertised an amenity kit that provides eye shades but I was never offered one. A pillow over my face eliminated some of the light. Bathroom is shared with economy this is not good. The economy flight crew work the PE cabin while we all sat there with empty food trays in front of us Business Class crew and the purser made a number of trips through the cabin and completely ignored the fact that the cabin needed service. My result is either take a daytime economy flight or upgrade to business. PE is not value for money a separate bathroom and a couple of dedicated cabin staff would make the experience better. Cathay need to learn something from Turkish Airlines their Comfort Class works very well.,0,5,T Tukla,2014-07-29,no,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,2,N/A,2,2,Cathay Pacific Airways

The flight from HKG to SIN the seat was uncomfortable as it can't be reclined back only the inner part is reclineable which is uncomfortable. Box of snacks is served around 1 hour later around 2.30am when people are starting to sleep instead of before arriving as a breakfast.

Flown CX all around Asia in the past 3.5 weeks and experienced all their fleet from the shell seat to the new seats found the new seats to be nice and wide but also hard under the legs. Shell seat well what were they thinking? All flights were delayed upwards of 30+ minutes that's right all! Crew well they make the airline and most of them couldn't be found after service was complete. The 747 I flew on needed some seat repairs as there were parts missing or taped over and the cleanliness was not exactly great. I didn't appreciate the fact that my table on a few flights was filthy. I do however like the fact that they fly to HND and that makes them a much better option than QF. Meal portions very small but overall ok.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Melbourne - Hong Kong - Frankfurt and return. Melbourne lounge dreadful - cramped viewless and poor food. Boarding chaotic especially in Hong Kong. Inflight service inconsistent - it seems business passengers are serviced last? The entire right hand side of the business class cabin was not offered bread during the meal service yet we all watched the basket being carried up and down the other aisle. Food not that good either - although of higher quality out of Melbourne and Frankfurt than Hong Kong. Requests for items (pillows drinks) required 2-3 times. They ran out of my preferred meal choice on both legs ""we did not expect Caucasians to order it"" said my flight attendant. Seat impossible to get comfortable on. I am only 172cm tall and 70kg but could not get a comfortable position. Odd padding sections on the seats and the very narrow foot well when sleeping filled me with regret that I had allowed myself to be talked into flying Cathay by my partner and not chosen to fly Singapore Airlines where you can stretch out and get proper service (in my view Singapore Airlines economy service is better than the Cathay business service).",0,5,Barry Miles,2014-07-27,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,2,N/A,3,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"CX 521 from Tokyo Narita to Hong Kong and CX 659 from Hong Kong to Singapore. Both trips were on the B777-300ER. Seats on these planes were so much better than the shell seats. They were the new ones used on the long haul routes. The touch screen PTVs were really sensitive which was good as compared to those on the old systems of the 777-300 and A330-300 as they hanged a couple of times when I used them. However not all was good. CX 521 was delayed for 2 hours because of bad weather at Hong Kong. We were only given a 500yen food voucher which was equivalent to 6 Singapore dollars. Anyway we were served coffee and tea from Tokyo to Hong Kong which really surprised me since they didn't do that for the Singapore to Hong Kong leg as well as the Hong Kong to Tokyo one. Service was a hit-and-miss affair but the staff were generally very polite with a few exceptions. The overnight ""meals"" offered on all Cathay Pacific regional red-eye flights: CX 659 was a red-eye flight and we were not offered any hot meals. We were only given a paper box which contained a muffin fruits a biscuit and an egg bun accompanied by a pack of lemon tea.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Maybe I was expecting too much from a regional flight. I was on CX 716 from Singapore to Hong Kong on 14th July. The economy class seats were the notorious shell seats and it was extremely uncomfortable. There was no lumbar support and the seat back was really hard. There was also no foot rest. In addition amenity kits and menus were not given out to us. What's worse was that when we boarded the flight not every seat had blankets and pillows on them and they were only available upon request and the entire process of passengers settling down into their seats was extremely chaotic as several passengers started requesting blankets and pillows from the cabin crew during pushback and the cabin crew were hurrying back and forth just to hand them the blankets and pillows. The food portions were also pretty small and I was still famished even after the meal service. The cutlery provided was also made of cheap plastic and not metal unlike on some other airlines. We were also not served tea or coffee throughout the flight. The cabin crew were in a rush to collect the meal trays from the passengers and when the pilot came on the speaker and requested for the cabin crew to take their seats for landing they did not even conduct a safety check for us such as making sure our seat belts were fastened window shades were lifted and hand carry items were placed under the seat in front of us. The only positive on my outbound journey from Singapore to Tokyo was that the cabin crew were really friendly and were always smiling. My inbound journey on CX was much better. I'll post a review on it after this.,0,2,Tan Alex,2014-07-22,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,4,2,Cathay Pacific Airways

Boarding was on time and by seat numbers. The plane was old and dated but with a refurbished interior with AVOD entertainment a huge difference from their ancient A330s and a few un- refurbished B777-300s and B777-200s. The AVOD was easy to use and had up to date movies. Music selection was really good for Asian music with new mandopop albums available. Inflight service was efficient and friendly. A full bar service with peanuts distributed followed by dinner meal service and drinks on a tray brought about twice. We had a choice of vegetarian mushroom fusilli with tomato sauce or pork with Chinese sauce with rice and Haagen Daz ice cream. Food was better on this leg. On this flight I had this fantastic female cabin crew member serving our side. During the bar service I asked for a gin and tonic and while making it she asked for my nationality then began chatting with me. I requested a set of playing cards as a souvenir and was given a writing kit in addition to the cards.

Due to the midnight flight we were given a snack box containing cold food. Terrible offering. A box of iced lemon tea was given. Service was by request after that and I got a gin and tonic on request. Trays of water were carried out twice.

The AVOD was easy to use and had up to date movies. Music selection was really good for Asian music with new mandopop albums available. Inflight service was efficient and friendly. A full bar service with peanuts distributed followed by dinner meal service and trays of drinks after that with bar service on request.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,11/7/14 CX736 SIN-HKG. B777-300 aircraft registration B-HNI. Got these 4 flights at S$660 so its the best value for money. Checked in online. There was a separate line for online check in at SIN so we breezed through check-in in a jiffy. SIN is always efficient anyway. Boarding was on time and by seat numbers.

We had a choice of chicken penne with tomato sauce or sweet and sour fish with rice and Haagen Daz ice cream. Food was decent and edible but nothing to write home about. My companion asked for an additional main course since he found the portions small. His request was granted after the meal service ended.

On this flight I had this fantastic female cabin crew member serving our side. During the bar service I asked for a gin and tonic and while making it she asked for my nationality then began chatting with me. I requested a set of playing cards as a souvenir and was given a writing kit in addition to the cards.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,17/7/14 CX659 HKG-SIN. Sparkling new B777-300ER aircraft registration B-KQO hardly over a week in service. This was the aircraft's 8th flight. Got these 4 flights at S$660 so its the best value for money. Transited in HKG from CX500 and had a 3hr layover. Boarding was late by 15 minutes and had no seating order all economy passengers just boarded at the same time. Full flight. The plane had a new fresh cabin smell with the latest seats and AVOD entertainment. The AVOD was easy to use and had up to date movies. Music selection was really good for Asian music with new mandopop albums available. Inflight service was conducted but there was barely any 'proper' service. Due to the midnight flight we were given a snack box containing cold food. Terrible offering. A box of iced lemon tea was given. Service was by request after that and I got a gin and tonic on request. Trays of water were carried out twice. I feel CX should at least offer a proper meal tray for being a 5 star airline not a snack box. At least people have the option whether they want to eat supper or skip it.,0,5,Chia Ty,2014-07-17,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,1,N/A,4,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Overall a good airline but seats could be more comfortable.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,We have just flown CX 111 Premium Economy to Rotterdam. Unfortunately the airline code shared from Hong Kong to Heathrow and then Rotterdam with British Airways. Cathay Pacific was light years better than BA. The plane was quieter the food and drinks much better the staff more attentive and friendly and the seats much much more comfortable compared to BA. The seat cushion was softer and the recline better the pillow almost full size and the blanket softer and larger. The entertainment system on BA kept cutting out. I would give Cathay 8 out of 10 and BA 6 out of 10.,0,8,M Heaston,2014-07-10,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

We were accommodated on a connecting flight No CX 882 (Seat No 40 A and B) leaving Hong Kong in the afternoon. We had requested for Asian Vegetarian food which we got on the flight from Bangalore to Hong Kong on Dragonair. To our surprise in the menu card on CX 882 the first meal was vegetarian pasta. On requesting this the hostess said they had no vegetarian food and offered us cup noodles.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,LHR-HKG-LHR. Seasoned traveller. Very disappointing service and food availability. Take-off delayed by over 2hrs due to 'troubleshooting' and only offered cups of lukewarm water after 1.5hrs of sitting on an uncomfortably warm full plane parked at the gate. First drinks service was very slow and ran out of a number of soft drinks (surprising as this was the first drinks service and we were in 5th row they served). Highly disappointed to be told during lunch service that had ran out of chicken (I reiterate we were in the 5th row they served) and only beef or vegetable pasta were available. More foresight needed when planning food demand or perhaps need better menu options if the majority of passengers were rejecting the beef? Food portions were also smaller than on other airlines and a mini KitKat does not constitute a 'dessert' when most other airlines would offer the KitKat as an addition to the 3 courses. No tea/coffee offered proactively after the lunch service needed to ask the FA for this. Only one meat option available again at dinner service (other meat option had again 'run out') or vegetable option. To their credit cabin crew were very apologetic and seemed almost embarrassed to tell us that it had happened again. Snacks counter was set up in the galley with a small assortment of sweet and savoury snacks that were regularly replenished. Cabin crew were very obliging when asked for non-alcoholic drinks. Seat seemed narrower than other airline economy seats and age-old problem once seat in front is fully-reclined does apply here; near impossible to reach my bag on the floor. Toilets were very clean and I did witness cabin crew doing regular checks of the facilities armed with air freshener. Inflight entertainment system was very good with many new movies available for viewing - adverts before every film/TV episode is annoying but you can fast forward through these. Overall poor flight experience but credit to good cabin crew. Only chose Cathay Pacific this time as flight time was more suited to my schedule but will definitely not choose Cathay over Emirates ever again.,0,6,Imogen Lau,2014-07-10,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,4,2,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew from CGK-HKG. Very disappointed with the service and the product CX actually offers as a 5 star airline flew with CX798 on the way to HKG. Upon boarding I had very high hopes for CX. Very surprised with the FA's on this flight - they rarely interacted with passengers and some were chatting with colleagues in the cabin upon boarding. The food was not reasonable for a 4.5 hour flight received a cold and not very nice sandwich in a box. My back ached due to the poor quality seats in economy. We hardly saw the crew in the cabin. The entertainment service was the only decent part of my journey movies were very up to date and kept us occupied for 4.5 hour flight.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,SIN-HKG-JFK. Both sectors departed and arrived on time. Was glad to have been on the 777-300ER from SIN instead of the A330 with the dated uncomfortable seats. Service on both sectors consistently good friendly and efficient. Meals sadly seemed to let the whole CX experience down. Portions are small and very uninspired. The meals on the long haul to NY were identical in size but were preceded with a menu. No hot towels or cold towellettes distributed. Crew were however very pleasant throughout the long nonstop and very obliging with drinks snacks. A snack counter was set up with a limited selection of drinks and eats. Cabin and toilets clean and seat comfort held for the 15 hours just. IFE selection was pretty good too. While everything works and is adequate it's not quite a 5 star airline experience in CX economy.,0,7,S Klass,2014-07-06,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,2,N/A,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,London to Hong Kong then onto Cebu. I was boarded first due to my hearing loss the flight left 20 minutes late but arrived in HK on time. The staff are still very good and friendly however they didn't have any fish cakes for my main course left and I was not able to eat meat - quite disappointed however they were very apologetic. They should have anticipated the demand. HKG to Cebu: Flight was 45 minutes late taking off and landed 30 minutes late a little surprised to be boarded on a new A330 airbus however the business class seats which is the same for long distance seems a little smaller compare to the Boeing 777. A major cock up with the stewardess only giving us two forms one for health and the other for passport and forgotten to give us another form for custom chaos at customs as none of the passengers had forms to give them. A real hassle also there was no meet and greet for me either.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew from Hong Kong to Brisbane via Cairns in May. We were offloaded from Virgin Atlantic to Cathay and paid to travel Premium Economy. We did get a wider seat but the cold hard muffin yoghurt and orange juice breakfast had to be a basic as they could get. I don't know what they got in economy but it couldn't have been any less. Hardly saw the staff they just weren't there or interested. We had to walk a long way through the economy class to get to the toilets so didn't gain anything for having paid extra. Unless you need the slightly larger seat don't waste your money paying extra fro premium economy as you don't gain anything.,0,4,M Bennet,2014-06-23,no,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,1,N/A,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Flew Premium Economy LAX-HKG-LAX on 777-ER. I have read many prior reviews about CP PE and the main point is that this product should only be compared to Economy not Business Class. I have also flown CP BC and it is a great experience all around. I am 6'2"" and the days of flying Economy across the Pacific are over! Understanding that the price can be about double after 15 hours I believe well worth the price. Was able to board early on both legs. Had a dedicated overhead bin. The private cabin in a plus. The seat was fantastic 34C which was back seat aisle. A bonus was the extra storage behind the seat. Even when the seat in front was fully reclined I never felt uncomfortable. The width of the seat the arm rest and comfort of the seat were all good! The entertainment system was fantastic! The noise cancelling headphones were excellent. I found the service to be adequate the food options were the same as BC including the wine options. Real silverware and linen. Had no problems getting drink refills or snacks. Had no problems sleeping had superb legroom. The adjustable headrest is a great plus! Able to de-plane ahead of EC which is nice. The extra price was definitely worth it to me as I felt completely rested after both legs which is invaluable. Also you if you have the opportunity to use SkyPier at HKG do it! Less than five minutes to get through immigration customs and security! Amazing experience! The check-in desks at SkyPier are efficient and fast!

The food was very good with a nice selection the lamb shoulder confit was superb as was the pork which was served as dinner before landing. The wines were good again a good choice.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Sydney - HKG - Milan and return Premium Economy. Sadly disappointed. Having flown premium economy or business on a number of airlines in recent years this definitely felt ""economy"". Service food and beverages were very average. Seat and entertainment acceptable. I note that the cost was equivalent to Singapore Airlines economy class via Singapore. Next time we'll opt for SA. Neither the food or the beverages offered were business class equivalent. Did I misunderstand what we were paying for? The crew were rarely seen but happy to step across passengers in the front row. No ""excuse me's"" were offered. The only flight where service was up to standard was HK-Sydney when the aircraft was not full.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,My wife and I travelled 4 sectors in Cathay Business Class recently (CX110/CX261?CX260/CX139). We have a benchmark from travelling frequently with Qantas in Business. Several major aspects warrant comment. My wife is diabetic which was nominated at the time of booking. On one long overnight sector she asked for a light snack as she had to take medication. The staff member disregarded the request and offered no snack. However on the return long overnight sector a staff member when asked offered that a special snack had been loaded and was most obliging. What an inconsistency in the attitude of cabin staff. There appears to be no small snacks available at any time as is the case with competitors. Seat allocation. Was arranged at the time of booking which was some six months prior to departure. Boarding passes were issued at Sydney for the two sectors. Upon presentation at Hong Kong we were informed of a problem i.e the seat was broken and would not recline thus was unusable. We were asked to go to one side whereon we asked for a supervisor. Apparently our adjoining seats were not possible as one seat was broken (by coincidence the frequent flyer award seat). As the flight was almost fully booked we were allocated seats apart five and six rows behind. As it was nearly midnight we had little alternative. Upon boarding we overheard a passenger seating next to my wife who wished to be repositioned nearer his friend. We were able to sort this out and then inform cabin staff. Sometime later (there was an hour and a half delay before takeoff due to weather conditions) we noticed the original seat was occupied and was fully reclined. This seat was the frequent flyer seat.,0,1,Fell Kevin,2014-06-12,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,2,N/A,1,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,My wife and I recently flew MEL-HKG-KIX and return and found the airline's standards have fallen since we last flew with them several years ago. The 777 seating between Hong Kong and Japan was particularly uncomfortable food on all legs was some of the worst we'd had eg. braised beef between MEL and HKG was almost all fat while 3 of the 5 Western meals on the HKG-MEL leg had onion sauce &/or onion ingredients. We were laughed at by the cabin staff member when in response to her question we asked for diet coke with our main meal between HKG and MEL. The entertainment system is good but there was little difference between the May programs and those on offer in June. Also the same advertisements before each program are very annoying after a while but at least you can fast forward through them. I doubt we would choose Cathay Pacific ahead of Singapore Airlines in future.,0,3,M Davies,2014-06-10,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,2,N/A,3,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

The inbound flight CX616 was cancelled without prior notice even though I already provided the airline with my full contact details including email when I bought the ticket online. Check-in staff said the flight was cancelled because the airplane didn't arrive from Hong Kong last night due to operational issues.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,JFK-HKG-SYD. No mention at the boarding gate for Premium Economy guests to board before Economy. Had a champagne prior to take off which was an improvement over our previous flight on Virgin Atlantic. The cabin service was friendly and attentive. The food was very poor the worst I have had to be honest not even Economy standard. The seats were wide but the old bugbear when the seat in front reclines fully is still a problem in Premium Economy it is very intrusive and you need the passenger next to you to climb out if you want to get past them. We got more sleep than previous flights in Economy but it is still a fairly uncomfortable experience. The noise-cancelling headphones were a great feature and you could actually hear and enjoy the comprehensive entertainment selection. The cabin noise was quiet having only 38 passengers and a dedicated toilet was a good feature on the JFK-HGK leg but we had to use the Economy toilets for the second leg (different aircraft). This was our first experience in Premium Economy and while it was a slight step up from Economy I do not think it is worth the extra money. Apart from the entertainment selection and wider seats it felt more like an Economy experience than Premium Economy to be honest. We would fly Economy next time have stopovers and avoid flying a 14 hour leg if we could as you do not arrive at your destination feeling particularly refreshed.,0,6,L Perrin,2014-06-01,no,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,2,N/A,5,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,My wife and I (both seniors) were in Premium Economy Class (Seats 31H and 31K) on flight CX879 from SFO to HKG (with connection to BLR) on 12th September 2013. During our onward flight from HKG to SFO in March 2013 we had felt very cramped in Economy Class and so we got our tickets upgraded for our return journey in September. Little did we know at that time what a wise decision that was. After the flight CX879 took off on 12th September 2013 the elderly passenger in front of us took ill. The flight was diverted to Anchorage in order to offload the passenger and then we landed at Taipei for crew change. Finally after being in the aircraft for 20 hours we landed at HKG on 14th morning very tired. We had of course missed the connecting flight. We were afraid that there would be a crowd and big confusion at the transfer counter. We thought we might have to spend long hours at the airport. We were in for a delightful surprise. We found a long table arranged with all the new boarding passes envelopes with hotel coupons and cash for meals also instructions for transport to hotel. We could not believe our eyes. We were accommodated at J W Marriott where we could take good rest and take the BLR flight on 14th night. We should also add that the 20-hour flight was made bearable because we were in Premium Economy. One complaint: On that long flight no clear announcements were made about our landing time arrangements made for connecting flights etc. Because of my good experience with CP last year I am again travelling BLR-HKG-SFO on July 22 2014 by Premium Economy. Even though the price was high for me I still decided to pay extra for the comfort.,0,7,Rajagopalan Raghavachari,2014-05-29,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Cairns - Hong Kong return. My seat tray table and screen had dirt on it and a repulsive odour. Flight attendant didn't care but did give me a towelette. Food was poor. Return night flight had dreadful service no hot beverages at all. Limited choices of others. The FA walked through a couple of times only with a couple of drinks on a tray and did his best to ignore everyone. The in-flight announcements in English were incomprehensible. These planes did not have any personal airjets and were uncomfortably warm.,0,5,Phil Scott,2014-05-27,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,2,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I am a fan of Cathay Pacific. They seem to me to be the most consistent in cabin service wherever you embark. Mostly I have travelled Business Class but have also travelled Economy on one occasion. I like a clean cabin and clean wash room facilities. Cathay Pacific seem to ensure that this is the case. The crew provide efficient helpful and pleasant service. Our last flight was LHR-HKG then HKG-MEL in May 2014. I like the flat beds on the Cathay Pacific 777. To me they seem longer than other airlines flat beds. LHR-HKG we were given Billecart Salmon champagne and very nice it was too. On the HKG to MEL leg it was Deutz. Not quite as nice as the Billecart. Food varied from good to excellent. The array of entertainment options was comprehensive.,0,9,Vivien Simon,2014-05-25,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,ADL-LHR via HKG. Check-in at ADL quick and easy well organised. Unnecessary delay with boarding process resulted in 20 mins late take-off. Stacked at Hong Kong landed 30mins late. Onward flight to LHR already closed so rebooked on later flight at 23:30. Given a hotel voucher but this didn't compensate for losing my previously selected aisle seat and having to then travel overnight to LHR arriving 05:45 am instead of 20:30pm the previous evening. Aircraft meals and cabin service could not be faulted and Premium Economy definitely recommended on longer journeys just a great shame that ADL to LHR schedule obviously does not allow enough time for flight transfer at Hong Kong so don't expect to fly straight through. Cathay Pacific you need to get your act together because passengers that get up at 4:00am for an early flight expect to arrive on time.,0,6,Brian Wilson,2014-05-23,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

First leg of flight fantastic service great stop in Hong Kong of 6 hrs a bit of a drag second half much better due to larger seats but service great all the way.

Overall a very positive experience especially for the money (585 pounds return which is exceptional value). The choice of entertainment isn't as extensive as on Emirates or SIA but was adequate with several of the latest movies offered. Service was friendly and prompt.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I was very disappointed with our flight from Rome to Hong Kong (flight CX292) on 7 May 2014. My son was travel sick and the flight crew were very unhelpful.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I flew on CX 889 from Vancouver to Hong Kong and found that the seats are too cramped and very uncomfortable. It was a Boeing 777-300ER plane and the seats were badly modified to make them closer to each other probably to accommodate more passengers. After the flight I couldn't walk as my legs became swollen due the cramped seating positions. My previous flights with Cathay Pacific weren't like this at all the seats were less congested and there were more leg room. On other recent flights like CX 2710 from Colombo to Singapore it was the same plane model Boeing 777-300ER yet the seats and leg rooms are adequate. (5hrs flight journey). Hope that Cathay can make amends on the seats for the flights to and from Vancouver.,0,1,Howard Wong,2014-05-11,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,3,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Dubai to Tokyo Haneda via Hong Kong. Price wise from Dubai Cathay is the best value for money to fly anywhere in Asia and given the fact that the first experiment went well I didn't hesitate to go for the next one. I was right again. Cathay is outstanding value for money to travel in Asia from Dubai. The first leg from Dubai to Hong Kong was flown on a 330-300 fairly new with the newest business class which is equivalent to first class in terms of comfort. Fully flat lie beds with a huge monitor plentiful of entertainment and nice environment. Service on- board is excellent. Service is prompt and flight assistants were excellent. The second leg was flown by an older 747 with an old seat configuration it can still convert into an 180 degrees bed but in my opinion it's not as comfortable for a 6 foot tall passenger even worse if the person is robust. In my case it was more than comfortable and the trip lasts between 3.5 and 4 hours. With a vast variety of lounges the waiting time at HK airport is no issue. Overall a wonderful experience and with these fares I'd only opt for Cathay for my Asian trips.,0,9,S Nicola,2014-05-11,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,DOH-HKG Airbus 330-300. Business Class. It is many years since I was a Diamond member of Cathay this is my first flight with them for nearly 15 years. Although the service was good they have gone downhill since my last journey. The seats are a strange design almost coffin like the food is pretty average as is the wine choice. No sleepwear like Qatar. The juice is carton not fresh.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,My family and I just flew from YYZ-HKG-KUL in February 2014. I must say it was a very long flight from YYZ-HKG. The check-in was very smooth and we got the boarding passes for both our sectors right at YYZ. The flight was wonderful. The IFE the meals the flight crew were all top notch. The cabin crew were very friendly and caring. Their service was exceptional. There were enough snacks made available to the passengers throughout the flight. The seating was okay. The kids really enjoyed the IFE contents. The transit at HKG was pretty quick and our next flight from HKG-KUL was excellent as well. Overall were had a wonderful flight on both sectors.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew from CDG to HKG and HKG to AKL return. The service was excellent. I had swollen legs from the first flight and a customer service rep helped me get a visa in to Hong Kong so I could see a doctor and then got me extra legroom on the next flight. Flight attendants checked on me every 20 minutes or so and got me extra blankets and water as needed. I was very taken care of and they went the extra mile. Overall all 4 flights were great: on time with good food and excellent entertainment. Seats weren't great- the life vest thing is in the seatbelt - but it's economy class. The bathrooms were cleaned often so were sparkling.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,HKG-LHR 25th April 2014 CX253. The first time I have flown with Cathay Pacific and it won't be the last. Excellent service throughout. Flew outward premium economy and flew back with business class. Aircraft was clean and tidy but the cabin crew were the stars of the show very attentive and pleasant without being too enthusiastic if you know what I mean. The food was excellent in both in premium economy and business class but business class certainly has the edge with the comfort and privacy. My wife doesn't normally sleep well when travelling in aircraft however the fully reclining seat was a great bonus which allowed her to get a few hours of good sleep. In comparison with other airlines I have travelled with the service that Cathay Pacific provides gives it that little bit extra. We can all say the seats are hard or the food needs a little bit extra but at the end of the day it is the staff who can make or break a journey and for me the staff certainly made it for me.,0,10,S White,2014-04-28,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,EWR-HKG in Premium Economy and HKG-EWR in business (thanks to an unexpected upgrade). Had a great experience in both classes attentive but not too present service new airplanes clean friendly on time good connections in HKG (although I found their inter-connection with their subsidiary Dragonair not optimal) classy. Would definitely fly them again. Premium Economy product was good and definitely worth it on a 16hrs flight. While meals are close to those of economy if not the same the cabin quietness and space are enough to make this worth it. Business class was one of the best I've been in with attentive and not over-present service classy and providing you with the options you need when you want them for a pleasant and relaxing flight. Cathay definitely carried the magic of Hong Kong on their flights. Business class seating and bed is very good roomy and comfortable.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,SYD-HKG-CDG return left April 12 return April 19. I flew this same route last June/July and chose to fly CX again. The flight to HK on 330 was very comfortable with excellent food and service. The inflight entertainment was good with a wide variety. I slept a little enjoying the flat bed. The flight to CDG later in the evening was in the small front business cabin. I wanted to try this because everyone raves about the cosier and more private space. I was in 11K. Small cupboards are located right here as well and these were accessed a lot by FA which was distracting and did wake me up several times. Also after dinner was served it is a long wait to breakfast. My only complaint is that the flat bed is much firmer than the 330 and in fact uncomfortable and difficult to sleep on at times. On the return flight from CDG-LHR I was in the main business cabin this time which was in fact quieter. The FAs did disappear for sometime and often were engaging in conversations in the galley and less interested in checking on PAX during the flight. When I requested a snack because it was way past dinner time in terms of Paris time the FA was at first a little put out by my request (a first in my experience flying CX). I also found the inflight entertainment almost identical on all flights and hence found it difficult to find anything to watch. Admittedly it was return flight in one week. The flight from HKG-SYD was very good with probably better service than the Paris legs. The food was good although the dinner was served only half way through the flight and then nothing for the last four-five hours. All flights were punctual and even early at times. It is a good value for money business class ticket especially as their business class is one of the best overall. I would fly CX business again even though not as good as last year.,0,8,G Alexander,2014-04-22,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I've flown for 10 years from Paris to HKG every month at least twice a month. I've seen the service quality whether in economy or business class drastically going down from 2009. The food has become much poorer quantity and quality-wise. The temperature in cabin was very cold and most of the time no more blankets left even for my 9 year old daughter. The online booking does not show you complete routes when booking a ticket. Example: HK to Singapore they don't mention there is a stop in Bangkok. So you just get the surprise at check-in. If you want to upgrade from your miles you need to buy a more expansive ticket and even then you are not sure you can be upgraded. Even as a frequent flyer of this company it became almost impossible to book a front row seat over the years. Before as a Marco Polo gold member I could easily get any seat I required.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew Business/Premium from Perth Australia to LHR and return. Cannot fault the crew on all 4 flights - they were very pleasant and efficient. Food and service in Business was very good and above average in Premium Economy. Ground/check-in staff at LHR very helpful with flight changes. The seats in Premium weren't the most comfortable but there was plenty of legroom which is always a problem for me being quite tall.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Sydney - Hong Kong vv with airbus 330 economy. Inflight service alright. Food very small the main portion was less than 300 ml in capacity. A bit meagre when compared with Qantas meals. Flight attendants very courteous. Seat in front of toilet so didn't disturb anyone when seat reclined. On the return flight congee served which suited the cultural background of most passengers. A choice of 3 meals didn't run out of choice. Sat next to toilet again toilet door didn't shut properly so ended up closing door for passengers most of the time. No 2nd offer of drinks unless on request.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,SGN-NRT and OSA-SN. Economy class. Having previously flew CX I was quite confident in the quality of the carrier. Nevertheless these last experiences came as a disappointment. For short/medium haul flights it seems that CX has definitely opted for the low cost low quality approach of the business. Between SGN to HKG the service was indifferent at best. Pax did not even receive a tray with the so called meal but simply a sort of hard paper food box. Drinks choice on offer were limited but large choice on request. I was not proposed any coffee or tea.

The only thing that I didn't like is the time it leaves. The flight there takes off at elevenish and flies through the Hong Kong day and when you're about to fall asleep you land.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew on the new route from Doha to Hong Kong (CX640). A very smooth and comfortable night flight of only just over 7 hours. The flat bed on this newly refurbished A330 was reasonably wide and there was plenty of space for hand luggage. Food was good and service was excellent. Only complaint was not with CX but with the Qatar Airport - on both my inbound and outbound flights the aircraft was requested to park miles and miles away from the terminal and the airport bus took well over 20 minutes to transport passengers to and from the aircraft.,0,9,A Tsui,2014-04-08,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I flew from LHR-CDG and CDG-HKG with BA and CX respectively it was excellent as CX managed to upgrade me from a normal Y to Y+ on the Paris-Hong Kong. It was my first time in PE and it made quite a difference since it was a 11 hour flight. There was a significant amount of legroom and the amenity kits and enhanced levels of service made the great difference in price between Y and Y+ that I should now consider in the future when it's a long haul flight. The movies were decent and varied and the cabin crew were flawless one thing that is particularly commendable as they really collaborated together and you felt that they were helping each other out as a team.,0,10,Jacob Choi,2014-04-06,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I have flown with Cathay many times before but always in Economy or Premium Economy. This was the first time that I have travelled Business Class with them. The flight was Hong Kong to Melbourne return and was on a newly fitted out A330 with the new style Business Class configuration (not the old style herring bone). Overall I was extremely impressed. The service food drink selection and entertainment were all excellent. However the best part of the flight was the seat which was probably the most comfortable business class seat that I have experienced plus there was ample storage space and compartments. The only thing to be aware of is that some seats are not exactly aligned with the window and so you have to crane your neck around the cubicle wall to see out of the window.,0,9,Walker Shane,2014-04-06,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"LHR-HKG-NRT and HND-HKG-LHR in Economy. I discovered that by travelling CX I could have a stopover at HKG on my trip to Tokyo at no extra cost to flying direct. 3 of the 4 flights were slightly delayed by no shows but we arrived on time or only a few minutes late in all cases. Overall the flights were very good with above average catering and comfortable seats. Cabin crew were excellent and were available throughout the flight. I would make a couple of comments. It would be nice if Cathay could fit ""ears"" to their economy class seats - it helps avoid getting a pain in the neck. Also it would be good to fit adjustable air vents above each seat. I found the first flight too hot when I got on the cold during the flight (although that was fixed by a trip to the loo to put my vest back on) - adjustable vents would help alleviate this.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CDG-HKG-SYD. My wife and I chose PE Economy because of the seat and we were not disappointed. A few extra inches in width and quite a few extra for legs with extra recline and a wide armrest with food tray inside. This all made a dramatic difference for our comfort on a 22 hour flight. It was possible to find a sleeping position. Also at meal times the seat in front did not interfere with the food table. Cabin staff were very friendly and professional a very solid product I would choose again.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX918 B77W MNL-HKG. I am not a regular user of CX but past recent experiences in their new Business Class have been good. The seat is excellent and the catering satisfactory. On this flight I was told that I was being upgraded to First Class but was then advised that there would be no First Class service just the seat and that the catering would be Business Class standard. Having selected a Business Class window seat as always in the CX type of lay-out I was allocated seat 1D in First Class. This is a single centre seat in CX’s apparently new First Class lay-out and can only be described as a cell. Its certainly spacious as you would expect in First Class nowadays but there is a feeling of being locked in to a high sided enclosure. The seat itself is like a bench its width would adequately seat two people and has no shape to it. Also there are no overhead bins only a small cupboard that forms part of the cell which is only large enough to take a small bag and a jacket. Roller bags have to be placed on the floor protruding out from underneath the foot-stool that forms part of the flat bed. It was sufficiently depressing that I asked for my Business Class seat back but the flight was full hence the “upgrade” and my seat had been allocated to someone else. The Business Class catering dinner on this flight – comprised an adequate fruit salad a main course where a choice of two meat in a sauce and rice and fish in a sauce and rice were offered up on a tray by the cabin attendant. They looked so unappetizing that I passed on the main course. Dessert was a dry looking piece of cake which I passed on as well. This was low standard Business Class catering at its worst there was no menu given so the actual content of the meal was down to guess-work. Finally we were told whilst in the Lounge that there were problems with the IFE on board. We then departed almost 2 hours late. Overall very disappointing and in comparable with other carriers in the Region.,0,1,Norman Mitchell,2014-04-02,no,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,1,N/A,3,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,HKG-LAX. Upgraded on miles to b-class. Great product all round - service plenty of privacy seat comfort and lie flat bed very comfortable making for a decent amount of sleep. Only complaint on this 12hr flight was the meal service timing and slight delay in drinks after take-off. Around 3hrs in dinner was served (which was excellent with a great selection of wines) and then followed around 5hrs later with brunch - some 4hrs out from the destination. It was explained this was in response to some customers providing feedback they got hungry. Odd as CX offer decent inflight snacks and also at odds with other 12hr flights. The service interrupted my sleep and whilst I asked for my brunch to be served 2 hours later and this was done some parts of the brunch offering were missed.,0,9,B Crockford,2014-04-01,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,SFO-HKG-MAA BLR-HKG-SFO (BLR-HKG on Dragonair) in early March. Enough has been said about the horrible shell seats on the 747-400s. One can only hope they replace these aircraft soon. Once again the special Indian vegetarian meal out of SFO was terrible. I have traveled this route 4 times over the past four years and the same entree has been served. I wrote to the airline about this but obviously to no avail. Food-wise things do generally improve on the other legs but in general the quality is going down. AVOD was superb with great sound and picture quality.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX have not disappointed me in 3 years of flying. Perhaps as a recognized traveler I get special treatment but never witnessed such with any other airlines. Point in case on recent JFK-HKG flight. I arrived on a late AA connection and had not checked my baggage through to HKG (only checked to JFK). Fearing I would miss my CX connection I did not bother to pick up my luggage at AA baggage claim and went straight to CX barely making the flight. Arriving in HKG I contacted CX baggage services. Even though my bag was not under their control not tagged for them they sent their JFK staff to AA baggage retrieved my bag put it on the next CX JFK-HKG flight and delivered it to my home.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX881 LAX-HKG in Premium Economy. After a number of recent flights on US airlines it was a real pleasure to step on board a Cathay Pacific plane. The PE product is great for the long haul and worth the extra investment. Far superior to BA's equivalent. Only downside is getting out of your seat if you are at the window (or center) when the seats in front are reclined - makes for a difficult clamber over the person in the next seat. Great service - friendly sincere and efficient. The separate compartment on the 777 is a plus especially when sat on the right side making for easy access to the dedicated washroom.,0,9,B Crockford,2014-03-26,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX828 HKG-YYZ business class seat 16K. Bravo CX. Puts the US carriers to shame. Got onboard and realized I was seated adjacent to a mother and her 3 young daughters in the second small cabin of business class and imagined there was going to be a lot of family chit-chatting so asked the purser if there was a window seat in the first larger business cabin available. She found a family member of a CX staff travelling on a pass and asked her to switch seats with me. I then used the lavatory and returned to my seat with a wad of tissue. This was noted by a flight attendant who arrived at my seat with an entire box of tissue for my use throughout the flight. That was thoughtful. Food was excellent particularly the hamburger from the mid-flight snack menu. I asked to have the first meal served 'express' with everything (appetizer entree dessert etc) on the tray delivered asap after take-off as I was really tired and wanted to just eat fast and sleep. This was no problem and done as requested. Seat comfort good - lots of storage space. Selection of movies and very good. Flight on time. Flight attendants couldn't have been nicer - polite obliging. No snarling and snappy quips like on United. Overall excellent business class product.,0,9,Mark LaPrairie,2014-03-24,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"TPE-NRT. I was looking forward to flying with a much-recommended airline for the first time. Kind of a ho-hum experience. Nothing special really. Limited entertainment. Food middling. Beverage selection awful. I finally asked the attendant if they had anything other than oolong tea or sugary drinks. She looked at me and said ""That is a very good question."" It took her several minutes to track down a single can of Perrier.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Hong Kong - Manila. Bumped the 4 of us from economy to Premium Economy since economy was overbooked. Seat was spacious and very comfortable (comparable to the business class seat of PR A320 business class seat). Food was okay (sandwich only since it's a 2 hour flight). Plane was a B777-300er. Transfer is a breeze. Inflight entertainment is very good (ranges from classical music to newest movies and concerts are also present including TV shows). CX is a benchmark of great airline service.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Melbourne to HK then HK to Rome and return. The MEL-HKG leg was okay again minimal services. The entertainment choices however were excellent. I have learnt from many other long haul flights and now take a soft full size pillow rolled up it makes the world of difference. They are pretty lenient with carry ons I feel the luggage limit of 20kg was a little lousy compared to other carriers. The meal was pretty normal airline food. The flight however was on time and our luggage got there safely. However the HKG - Rome leg was the horrible shell seats. Almost no padding. FA's were really very nice. I spoke to one about the seats and she said they use the old planes to Rome as there are facilities for the staff to sleep and that they use the newer planes for the Melbourne leg. On the return leg we were given a few little packs of cookies. On our trip from Rome to HK we found for some unknown reason our pre-selected seats were changed and my husband and I were apart. We asked about this and they fixed at the check in desk. However onboard someone else had a boarding pass for one of our seats so staff had to quickly find her a seat somewhere.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"We flew on CX250 on 28/2. Check in at LHR was bad as the business class desk was not obvious and we were ordered to use the kiosk. This spat out our lounge pass which confused the lady who realised that we were novices and was trying to be helpful. Eventually all the paperwork was sorted and the cases sent on their way. The lounge was comfortable boarding straightforward and we found our seats. Initially it looked good but no one ""showed"" us round so we did not discover a locker in which the headset was stowed and within which was hidden the socket to plug them in. The IFE was better than the listings for classical the music indicated but the audio books appeared to be very limited. dinner drink was offered to one of us but not the other. Dinner was a disappointment - smallish portions minimal garnishing and the advertised pork was substituted by chicken. The bed was clever but this meant that in the day position there was no support for the lower legs. No pillow or mattress the lack of the former forced my wife to use her blanket as a pillow so she was cold. Breakfast was dire although the cups of tea were better than average. The crepe was a soggy scrambled egg. The flight attendants were not alert and failed to realise visual handicap something that needs to be added to their training.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX170 and CX888 PER-HKG-YVR on A330 and 777ER. Firstly Qantas lounge at Perth is ordinary but did the job for an hour. Trip from PER to HKG was quite good with food okay service friendly & seat being comfortable. HKG to YVR was excellent all round again and slept 7 of the 11 hours. Overall very good but find that the 777ER is significantly more spacious and comfortable seat then the A330 (due to cabin width). I would also recommend getting an extra duvet or 2 (you get 1 initially) as these are quite thick and can be used as a type of mattress when sleeping it really made the world of difference on the 2nd leg for me.,0,9,B John,2014-03-03,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

There was a delay in takeoff from Heathrow due to strong winds causing us to wait onboard the plane for 30 minutes but the pilot kept us well informed of the situation. Although this flight wasn't as perfect as my last flight (CX233) possibly because it was a full flight the crew were attentive and helpful. The meals weren't as good as last time (no chocolates or Haagen Dazs) but it was still edible (with Chinese spicy chicken and congee) and above what you would typically expect in economy.

Qantas business lounge in Brisbane was not very good with limited selection of food and unfortunately did not have a chance to sample CX's many lounges in HK. On board the flight staff were friendly and efficient - especially the customer service managers on both flights.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX708 and CX709 17-19 Jan 2014. My friend and I booked our flight specifically with confirmation that we would have flown with the new business class seat on Boeing 747. Upon check in we were told that we were to fly on an Airbus 330. We boarded the plane and I was in shock. The seats were exactly the same as 10 years ago but older due to aging. The seats were old and ugly with a width of other '5-star' airlines premium economy class and recline of their economy! Lights were flickering during take off. My seat was broken and could not upright to 90 degrees for take off and landing. I was told at least 3 times by a steward to adjust my seat upright before he accepted the fact that my seat was broken. I was not offered another seat as the flight was fully booked. Personal TV screen was even smaller than my Samsung Galaxy phone with broken green and flickering display. When I tried to ask if there was power socket to charge my phone I was told that there wasn't one available! I tried to sleep but I could not because the seat was so uncomfortable with almost economy class recline. Instead of flying a bigger newer plane to replace reduced flight they decided to fly the oldest of the oldest. We were greeted with at least 5 idle Boeing 747 upon our arrival in Hong Kong. My flight back was the same plane type with the same discomfort but with a worse selection of food. The flight was not the cheapest but the most uncomfortable of all the choices I have.,0,1,Patt Tav,2014-02-10,no,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,3,N/A,4,1,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,HKG-KUL - one way. My wife and I are touring the Far East and this one way trip of 4 hours with CP was very good indeed. The plane was newish and the seats as good as International BA Club World. Its sort of odd in the recline as the whole thing seems to go up - vertically. But very comfortable when you get the hang of it. Food very tasty - had smoked salmon and Asian Chicken followed by fruit. All good. Drinks all chilled. FAs on the mark - friendly and efficient. Was it worth the £1000 each - actually I thought it was. The lounge was a odd experience - good food and booze etc - but weird plastic seats and tables that looked like a local HK bog standard eating house.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Recently flew from Okinawa Japan to Sydney Australia round-trip (used Dragon Air to go from Hong Kong and Okinawa). One recommendation is try to avoid flying during the Chinese New Year which is very busy we flew January 19th and return flight was Feb. 4th and both flights were full. Our return flight was on a Tuesday (from Sydney to Hong Kong) and was absolutely chaotic and full. I found the Flight Attendants to be very helpful and extremely nice (compared to US Carriers). Our 2 yo daughter was screaming/crying and they were very attentive. Tried to upgrade to Economy Plus but not available. Economy is not going to be comfortable on any airline you choose (9 hr flight from Hong Kong to Sydney). Plan on little to no sleep on if in Economy with the seating. Most flights are red eyes to and from Hong Kong and Sydney. Food was ok and they do feed you no matter the time. We were annoyed as we flew back from Sydney as they fed us at 11pm we were hoping they would darken the cabin to help our daughter sleep no such luck. Inflight entertainment system was great. I would recommend Cathay Pacific but try to upgrade to Premium Economy if you can and again avoid flying 2 weeks before and after Chinese New Year if going through Hong Kong because it will be busy!,0,5,B Becker,2014-02-07,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,4,N/A,5,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Business Class LHR to AKL. LHR to Hong Kong leg was with Cathay and the HK to AKL leg provided by Air NZ as code share. On the whole Cathay was superior with the exception of the food which was excellent on Air NZ. Cathay business class seating provided excellent space and storage and the configuration 1x2x1 with each seat angled away from the aisle ensured privacy. This contrasted with Air NZ which had less storage and not as much privacy as seats have lower screens and are angled towards each other. The Air NZ lie flat bed with mattress was comfortable but requiring the crew to make up the bed was an irritation. The inflight entertainment was far superior on Cathay Pacific. The Air NZ controls were very dated and the screen was small compared to other airlines. Overall service from flight crew was very good with both airlines. Disappointing that a lounge pass was not provided at check-in because of the codeshare status and I was instructed to use the Air NZ lounge at Hong Kong but on arrival discovered Air NZ shares the Thai lounge which was disappointing to say the least. Codeshare also meant that I couldn't check in on line for the non Cathay legs. I chose the code share flight combination as it offered the opportunity to experience two different business class services. Next time I would select flights only from Cathay pacific as Air NZ was disappointing. I understand that the Hong Kong to AKL route is provided by older fleet and it felt like it.,0,8,M Whitmore,2014-02-05,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,4,3,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"Cathay's cabins on regional flights were in need of a re-do and a clean up. Cathay has rolled out a new ""regional business class"" seat that has partially addressed the upgrade but has totally ignored passenger comfort in the seat. First the seat is hard. On a short sector Manila/Hong Kong I found the seat uncomfortably hard and actually found my back aching. How can they have padded the seat so sparsely? Secondly the seat does offer some recline and an opportunity to snooze although not quite enough especially if one is tall. I'm short 5'8"" and my feet were bumping the apparatus in front of me that housed the next seats. Truly 2"" more of leg room would have been very good and one wonders why Cathay made the pitch so tight. Thirdly the seat has no foot rest - a true failing. How did this happen? In all Cathay's service is good and attentive but the seat in the new regional business class needs a respectable amount of padding 2"" more pitch and a place to rest one's feet when reclined!",0,5,Serge Grynkewich,2014-02-03,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

This is the second time that I have taken Premium Economy from HKG to HND. On ground welcome drink is nice. Food is ok but it can improve a bit. Cabin crews are nice and friendly. As usually Cathay Pacific flights on-time. If they add a mid-night flight from HKG to HND will be better just like CX524 HKG-NRT.,0,10,Kwai Cindy,2014-01-29,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,YVR-JFK round trip. This flight is a bit weird because it carries passengers from HKG to JFK via YVR. It collects some passengers from YVR to JFK. Captain greeted passengers with weather and flight information. Flight to JFK was full but flight crew served drinks and food together then with another round of drinks before shutting off the lights to let people sleep. An hour before landing flight crew walked the aisles with water jugs to serve water. On the way back from JFK to YVR the flight was only a third full. Check-in staff gave me a full row to myself. My phone charger broke so I asked for one and the FA gave me her personal charger. The 777 has touch screen entertainment with USB access massive collection of movies and TV shows. Good airline overall the HKG-YVR-JFK route however is mostly going to be a red eye flight the return flight was less stressful.,0,7,L Kong,2014-01-28,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,HKG-TPE. I have travelled several times with Cathay Pacific and I am always very impressed with their service. On my return flight I arrived early at the airport. At the check-in they told me that my flight was slightly delayed. Because they feared that I might miss my connection to Europe in Hong Kong they automatically rebooked me on the flight one hour earlier very professional! The flight experience itself was as always impeccable.,0,10,N Petersen,2014-01-28,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,I have travelled Cathay Pacific in the past and enjoyed the experience but have to say my last two flights from Perth to Hong Kong then Hong Kong to Tokyo Haneda were very average. The plane was looking old (in economy noted that first class and business looked like they had been renovated). My entertainment system did not work on the first flight. Rarely have I found an airline meal so bad I would not eat it but the Hake was disgusting and the scrambled eggs the next morning also awful. On the first flight the cabin crew were abrupt I realise it was a full flight but I still expect pleasantness. The service was minimal and seemed rushed and a bit sloppy. I thought it might have been just me but when I caught up with my husband and son who had flown the same route two days earlier we laughed because they too had exactly the same experience. I'm hoping to enjoy my return trip in a weeks time more.,0,3,Smith Nanette,2014-01-28,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,1,N/A,2,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX270 AMS-HKG and CX767 HKG-SGN. Flight from Amsterdam in an A340 had the old herringbone Business Class seats - I actually really liked having my own private 'pod'. The cabin crew were some of the friendliest courteous and most genuine I have ever been served by in the sky - nothing was a problem to them. The inflight food was beautifully presented and cooked. I admit being 6ft 5ins tall the flat bed is too short to lie flat but even though I wish they designed seats for taller people it is still possible to get some sleep. Their lounges at Hong Kong Airport are outstanding - there are 6 of them! The flight to Ho Chi Minh City was on an A330 with the old regional seating not the new 777 with new business class seating (aircraft change) but still the serene comfortable professional service and great food. I'm not surprised that Cathay Pacific is a 5-Star airline - other airlines like BA could learn so much from them.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,HKG-KUL. The plane is embarrassingly old. My seat was broken as was the entertainment system. The flight attendants do their best but the airline really leaves them high and dry with the product they are putting up. It happened that my schedule was such that I returned to HK on Malaysian Airlines (a code share with Cathay) and that was much better. The Malaysian Airlines staff were excellent the plane was new and it all worked very nicely.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,London Heathrow to Hong Kong and back economy both ways. Flew on the last 747 service from London to Hong Kong on 31st December 2013. We were all given a lovely commemorative postcard set at the gate. As we taxied a firetruck water canon salute was in operation although the fact that it was pouring with rain rather spoiled the effect! Seats were reasonably comfortable and although I know others find these older style 'sliding' recline Cathay Pacific seats not so comfortable at least you don't get problems with the person in front if you reclining their seat all the way back. Food was nothing special neither was the movie selection and crew not the most attentive I was expecting Cathay Pacific in-flight service to be up there with the other major Asian airlines and so was a little disappointed. Return flight Hong Kong to Heathrow was on a 777. It may be my 'shape' but I just could not get comfortable in these seats (economy class) and unlike the old style 747 seats the new 777 seats recline by tilting and so inevitably the person in front of me decided to recline fully for the entire flight. This combined with the uncomfortable seat (no lumbar support and either very low armrests or high seat cushion - I couldn't work out which) made it one of the most unpleasant long haul flights I have taken in recent years. Cabin crew not friendly (aside from one female cabin attendant who seemed to be doing more work than all her colleagues and who was genuinely personable and friendly) and as on the outward leg cabin crew not especially attentive. Very relieved to land at LHR and get off this flight.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX100 SYD-HKG in Premium Economy class. On ground welcome drink and hot towel. I took the first row window seat and it was nice that next to my seat was empty. The meal was great not worse than Business Class. Inflight snack you can choose noodles chips biscuit or apple. One thing is not good enough in PEY cabin is that they do not have a restroom on Airbus A330-300. The 773-300ER has one restroom. I am glad that they still provide Business class headsets in PEY cabin. It helps reduce engine sound. The seat was just like regional Business seats.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,SYD-HKG-NRT. Boarding was very efficient on both flights. The service was attentive efficient and pleasant on both flights. The SYD-HKG flight was serviced by an A330 with the new economy class seats. The new seats were very comfortable with good legroom and plenty of storage space. Two full sized meals were served on this flight - the first was quite average but the second was delicious. The HKG-NRT flight was serviced by a B773 with the old economy class seats. These seats were not the most comfortable but thankfully I had three to stretch out over. I found the IFE system Studio CX a little harder than average to use at first but the range of entertainment options was outstanding.

The 9hr flight was very smooth and quiet the service on board faultless food was first rate and the seat in Business Class was very comfortable to sleep in.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,HKG-SIN-HKG. The outbound flight (CX739) was a 77W which is equipped with the latest long-haul seats. Seat was comfortable and the AVOD was working properly. However I was disappointed with the meal portion and the service. Requested a cup of hot tea for 3 times to 3 different crew members but still also unattended. Finally I went to the gallery to ask for a cup of tea. The return flight (CX714) was a retrofitted regional A330 (B-HLT). The service was much better. The crew was friendly and was very willing to assist me with the luggage. Water service was offered throughout the whole red-eye flight. A thumb up to the team.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew from London to Hong Kong then onto Cebu flying with B777 and A340. Arrived at Heathrow a tad early and was checking in first class as there was nobody at business check in. The man behind the check-in was a delight. I proceed to the lounge and staff made a fuss of me. The check in staff member came over and said he would escort me to the plane and allow me to board my seat first. Flight delayed 40 minutes but the cabin crew had served champagne and after take off dinner was served. I only watched one film as I was managed to sleep for 7 hours. Breakfast was great. Connecting flight to Cebu on an A340 and it was interesting to be seated in the old style funeral type business seat I can see why most hated it but I am not bothered as it was only a 2.5 hour flight. On arrival a Cathay Pacific staff member was waiting for me and quickly escorted me to immigration - from the moment I got off the plane through to immigration luggage and customs it took 6 minutes. My return trip this year after spending Christmas and New Year was on a much newer business class seats and such an improvement. Tried out the new Bridge lounge the staff are a delight again. Boarded first to my seats and the staff recognised me and made sure I was comfortable.,0,10,S Howard,2014-01-13,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,HKG-CMB-HKG (via BKK). B777-300. Business Class Regional Product. Boarding at HKG could be improved and the flight departed 45 minutes late and also landed late in CMB. Service food and beverages very good and the new regional business class seat is a huge improvement in comfort practicality features and style. However it lacks a privacy screen between seats and jumping over the sleeping aisle seat passenger's feet is more difficult due to more legroom under the seat in front. A one hour stop each way in BKK where passengers to CMB or HKG must remain on board per Thai government regulations. Baggage delivered promptly in CMB. Business Class check-in staff member in CMB was outstanding. The Araliya Lounge that is used by all airlines except Emirates and SriLankan Airlines continues to be a disappointment. Return flight departed CMB on time but was delayed at BKK. Overall CX is a great option in this region though the new seats are not as good as SIA's regional product. CX also has a HKG-CMB-HKG flight via SIN and that's a better route as passengers are allowed to wait in the lounge during the one hour stop.,0,7,B Wijesinghe,2014-01-10,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,4,5,Cathay Pacific Airways

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX711 HKG-SIN. B777. Unimpressed with boarding procedures. Cathay staff all over the place and did not direct passengers to correct queues especially after call to gate was issued late. Design of Hong Kong Airport doesn't help as queue snaked all the way to the next gate (and thankfully that gate was not open otherwise it would have been a complete mess). Flight departed 20 minutes late. I think Cathay's on ground service at their hub can be so much better if there's better co-ordination between Cathay and HKIA. Anyway once on board the service was much better. Attentive cabin crew served drinks promptly after takeoff and decent early dinner was served one hour into the flight. Seat was good with decent legroom and once again the IFE was also good.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX714 SIN-HKG. Arrived at Changi and found myself pleasantly upgraded to Business Class as Economy Class was full. Service was excellent all round - champagne and juices before take off and supper service was prompt. Aircraft was an A330 with new regional product I believe. The seats were lovely just what you need when your flight departs at 1am but alas could only take forty winks and not a proper night's rest especially during such a short flight.

The food served was not good especially for a five-star airline. The plane was supposed to leave the airport at 19.10 but was in the air at 19.45. As we boarded there was an overhead cabin which opened up. 3/4 way to Jakarta one of the toilets went out of service.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,JFK-HKG-CMB 12/18. We purposely like to fly out of JFK to catch Cathay's afternoon non-stop to HKG vs. flying out of LAX (plus get a couple of nights in NYC). Check-in at JFK is with BA. They don't offer any of the special services you find at JAL FC check-in or AA Flagship (an airline employee walks you counter check-in through Security to the Lounge). Priority TSA is not available at the early afternoon hour. Luckily regular security did not have long lines. Cathay uses the BA FC Lounge which is not special and needs a major refurb. The 777-300 had Cathay's new refreshed FC cabin. The flight is so special it makes up for the mediocre airport experience. The FAs are simply the best. Lunch and dinner meal services on this 16+ hour flight can't be beat. The menu has a wide variety of choices. I had the lamb which was perfectly cooked to my requested preference medium rare. Turn down service PJs (an upgraded PJ very comfortable) and inflight entertainment are the best of the Asian carriers.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,LAX-HKG. B77W. First Class. The aircraft had the newest special dark green paint scheme celebrating Hong Kong. Check-in was good but boarding delayed and not well organized due to late arrival of the aircraft. The much-advertised refurbished First Class cabin is a huge disappointment. The reflection of Chinese heritage through dark stained wood veneer finishes and rich silk-like fabrics have been replaced with very cheap and common-looking grey plastic and light stained wood veneer finishes and ordinary grey fabrics. Perhaps this was a hastily assembled early product for this signature paint scheme aircraft as the fit and finish of most components were very poor and the new seat padding a disappointment on a 15 -hour journey. Cabin service was top-notch from sincerely caring staff. However they could improve in the area of anticipating customers' needs. The meals were well-prepared but the menu offered very few choices and didn't offer more upscale entrees. The beverage selection was excellent with some very good wines on offer. While CX continues to offer an excellent First Class product it needs to up its game in light of recent upscale competitors in Asia and the Middle East.

Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,JFK-HKG-SYD in Premium Economy a very long flight with every seat filled JFK-HKG. The aircraft cabin was in excellent condition. The cabin crew were smiling and immaculately groomed which is more than I can say for Qantas with whom I usually travel. I pre-ordered a Lacto Veg meal. I was offered a glass of champagne prior to take-off but when I requested one with the meal service I was told there was none and I could have red or white wine no mention of what it was and it was served in a disposable plastic tumbler. The veg main course was good. The dessert on the tray was fresh pineapple which I cannot eat because of medication I take. When the standard meal ice creams were offered I requested one but was told I couldn't have one as it may not be vegetarian. A second meal was served a few hours later but to my surprise the main course on my tray was exactly the same as the previous one. Cups of noodles were offered once during the long night flight other snacks listed on the menu were not offered but had to be obtained from trays in the galley. If you are seated on the left side of the 777 to get to the lavatory which is on the right side at the front of the Premium Economy Cabin you need to go back through the E/C cabin cross over through the centre galley and then back up to the front and vice versa to get back to your seat. On the HKG-SYD sector I moved seats to enable the person next to me more room as he had to go straight to work on arrival. When breakfast was offered I told the cabin attendant I had moved and that I had ordered a veg meal. I did not want to leave them short a breakfast tray. I was told they that would get my meal. When it arrived what I think was an economy tray was put in front of me on which was a bowl with 5 cubes of melon half a plastic tumbler of apple juice a dry bread roll and a main course which did not appeal. There was no butter no jam no croissant no yoghourt all listed on the Premium Economy menu. In my opinion Cathay Pacific has a long way to catch up with their Premium Economy service.,0,4,Doug Blaik,2013-12-16,no,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,2,N/A,2,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,CX-617 from HKG to BKK. The flight was on time. Seat and Entertainment service were fine. The meal served rather disappointing I had a chicken curry on rice which only filled half the container.,0,5,Tejatanalert Sukasem,2013-12-12,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,4,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"HKG-ICN - my wife and myself had some difficulty in getting our seats assigned. Initially I thought this is due to our ""ultra competitive fare"" not allowing advance seat reservation but the real reason seemed to be that Cathay made an equipment change from A333 to B773 at very short notice only hours before departure. Thus we did not get the desired twin-seat in the Airbus but a neighbour in the 3-3-3 configuration of the 777. All the rest was ""standard procedure"" in Cathay's five star level. On time departure arrival ahead of schedule well managed inflight service despite a full cabin. Friendly and polite cabin crew but clearly focussed due to the number of pax to be served. AVOD ok but this is not ranking high in my priority list. I prefer a good choice of reading options which I got plus a decent meal and a good beverage selection. This being a morning flight the emphasis was more on tea and coffee - and only later on wine. I got all I needed and am once again really content with Cathay.",0,8,Hans Roloff,2013-12-10,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,5,N/A,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,"SFO-DXB/SIN-SFO Our first time on CX Premium Economy. Seats are fairly comfortable with decent legroom and an excellent VOD system. Food not much different from that served in Economy and they acted surprised when we requested a cocktail before dinner. The much advertised ""separate check-in and separate boarding lines"" were available in SFO but nowhere else. All in all not a bad experience but they have a long way to go to match the Premium Economy of Air New Zealand and Qantas.",0,7,Gary Greene,2013-12-09,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,3,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew CX in Nov 2013 from BKK-SIN and then SIN-HKG a few days later in economy. Both flights were mediocre. Legroom is very lacking. Food very average. FA's however were very good and attentive. I booked these tickets 6 months earlier yet CX arbitrarily changed our seat assignments on the SIN-HKG leg and my wife and I were seated 10 rows apart. No apology no effort to correct their error. Also I had booked and paid for Premium Economy and was told no PE on these legs. Yet the SIN-HKG flight clearly had a PE cabin which was half empty. Not very fair. Both flights did leave and arrive on time. Baggage delivery by CX quite slow in BKK and SIN and HKG.,0,5,James Gerwin,2013-12-07,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,2,3,N/A,5,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew LAX-HKG return in Nov 2013 in Premium Economy. Good value for money. Seats were reasonably comfortable with adequate leg room. An inflatable seat cushion made my bottom more comfortable. FA's were friendly and attentive. Food was decent for airplane food. A/V was excellent with high quality screens and a huge program menu. Would certainly recommend CX for transpacific trips. Only complaint would be that there are not enough toilets on this 777 aircraft.,0,8,James Gerwin,2013-12-07,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,HKG-JFK 25 Nov 2013. Business 777-300ER. Very comfortable pods with lie-flat seats that promote comfortable sleeping conditions. Extremely attentive staff anxious to serve. Decent food very good wine and I believe 4 hot towels during the roughly 15 hour flight. Compared to Korean Air's business class on A380 where the entire upper deck is for business the cabin seemed a bit more confined (and frankly comparable to Korean's 777 business class) but a very good experience. Plenty of storage very clean restrooms (frequently serviced during the flight) good video system and excellent headphones. Certainly an expensive alternative to Premium Economy but clearly a step above.,0,9,E Walsh,2013-12-06,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,JFK-HKG 17 Nov 2013. Premium Economy on 777-300ER featured not only more legroom and more deeply reclining seats but a wider arm rest between seats resulting in a sense of not crowding the passenger next to me (or vice versa!). Odd that dinner would be served at approximately 2.00 am when all I wanted to do was sleep. All-in-all a pleasant if lengthy trip and because of a small subsection of the cabin reserved for this class it provided a feeling of relative seclusion. Very attentive staff. Avoid bulkhead seats as people walking down the left aisle using restroom on right side of aircraft must walk across the outstretched legs of passenger reclining there.,0,6,E Walsh,2013-12-06,yes,Premium Economy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,4,N/A,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flew from Singapore to Taipei via Hong Kong recently. The departing flight was as usual the new 777-300 regional economy class seats are good with touchscreen VOD but not much selection. Not many complains for this leg except for the fact that there is an irritating pack of stuff on the left hand side of the seat belt. For the return flight from Taipei to Singapore I was surprised that they upgraded the plane from an A340 to a 777-300ER. I loved the seats. I was also surprised that they serve a box of food followed by a packet of oolong tea. The VOD selections for this flight is not much only a selection of music and television programs. Flight from Hong Kong to Singapore was a horrible flight. The boarding procedures for economy class were unbearable I was forced to put my carry on luggage 4 rows behind my seat as the flight was fully loaded and people brought lots and lots of shopping bags onboard the flight. Flight CX735 was delayed 50 mins. The flight attendants were very kind and always offered to help passengers.,0,8,Lee Cheng Jun,2013-12-05,yes,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,3,4,N/A,5,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,In recent years I have noticed massive improvements in the service of CX flight ground staff and reservations etc. I now attempt to use HK as my transit point to anywhere Asia. My most frequent route being LHR-HKG-PEN return so that allows me to test both long haul and regional the same time. Long haul depending on which flight the old configuration on the 747-400 is still very comfortable especially when travelling solo but not great when travelling in pairs or if you like looking out the windows. I always like sitting on the upper deck. The new configuration on the 777-300ER are by far the best business class seats I have ever experience. You can have great view outside or in pairs the middle seats allow both privacy or dining together depending what you enjoy. Extremely comfortable travel all round with great food and service. They clearly take service very seriously as majority of flights I have been on with CX I was asked if I would like to do a detailed written survey. It's extensive but something I am always happy to do. It's clear that consistently over the years the scores are moving more and more positive from my point of view. I used to dread the long journeys but now I look forward to them when I know I am travelling Cathay.,0,9,W Teoh,2013-12-04,yes,Business Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,5,4,N/A,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Flying for the second time this year with Cathay Pacific (Economy) and it's not as good as it used to be before. I was not able to reserve a seat online for my flight from MNL to AMS. I called the HQ in Manila and they advised me to come to the airport on time so I could reserve my seat (I wanted to upgrade to premium or business). Arriving at Manila International I found out that I was not able to upgrade in any way. From Manila to Hong Kong the flight was ok we had a new airplane and the seats were comfortable. Though we only got a cheap snack even though our flight was at 8pm and people were hungry. From Hong Kong to Amsterdam the flight was delayed and we had to move from Gate 69 to Gate 31. Finally we got to board our flight to Amsterdam only to find out that we were using an old airplane again. For some reason they use old airplanes to Amsterdam all the time lately. Same with routes from Hong Kong to Rome I was told by a stewardess. But flights from Hong Kong to Milan do have new airplanes. All in all super uncomfortable chairs and again I got back pain during the flight. Really the worst I have experienced with intercontinental flights. On another note: big difference in treatment between business and economy. I mean yes business class and first class do have the right to be treated a bit different since they paid for it. But I haven't experienced a nice service from the crew unlike I am used to when flying other airlines. It would be nice if Cathay can have a look at this. For now I will choose another airline next time going to my home country.,0,2,N Gaastra,2013-12-04,no,Economy Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,1,2,N/A,2,2,Cathay Pacific Airways
Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,JFK to SIN. Cathay is nothing but consistent the cabin crew remain above average as long as you express your needs all the time. They will not come to your seat to ask what you need even turning down the bed. The ground crew are just awful to pay a premium fare to get abused like this almost leaves you in tears. The icing on the cake are the personnel at Asia miles I must have come within a whisker of having a heart attack. They are brutally bad. I think that Cathay ground crew must be looking up to BA and Qantas for inspiration. From now on I am going to try Qatar the extra couple of extra hours have to be worth it!,0,5,Hugh Forward,2013-12-03,no,First Class,N/A,N/A,N/A,4,3,N/A,4,3,Cathay Pacific Airways
